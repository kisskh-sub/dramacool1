00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:13.640
(Episode 12)

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:21.599
Weren't you quite brave that day?

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:22.640
You fought back.

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:24.400
This is different.

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:26.680
Look, it's so cruel.

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:29.120
Hurry up.

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:37.400
Are you trying to kill me?

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.320
I don't know how to do this!

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:44.520
Let me teach you.

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:49.160
You have to pay tuition for this.

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.320
So there are things
you're afraid of too.

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:02.040
What are you doing?
Are you flirting here?

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:04.440
Hurry up. Crazy people.

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:10.760
Why don't I do it?

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:12.560
Okay.

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:29.800
You're really weird.

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:33.840
Logically speaking,
you're part of the Tong family now.

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:35.240
But you're still delivering fish.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.239
Have you thought about going back...

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:38.840
to the Tong family
to be the young master again?

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:42.800
I'd be lying if I say
I haven't thought about it.

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:44.880
But I'm used to being free.

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:46.440
The people there...

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:51.200
are too scary. It doesn't suit me.

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:53.520
Right.

00:01:53.521 --> 00:01:55.520
If I were you,
I'd make the same choice.

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:58.240
I'm free-spirited
and want to be uninhibited.

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:02.000
You don't know how lucky you are.

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.880
What if I'm not lucky at all?

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:14.600
I guess we won't know that.

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:26.600
What's wrong?

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:46.840
You want me to take
the initiative for this?

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:01.400
Why did you suddenly
ask me out today?

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:03.760
Is it about work?

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:05.559
Is work the only way...

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:06.560
you and I can see each other?

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:08.120
Da Huan.

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:09.760
Don't stress yourself out.

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:13.200
I'll take care of the merger.

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.680
I'll give you a solid foothold
in the Legal Department.

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:20.080
Thank you, Yu Chen.

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:23.480
There are indeed many things
I don't yet understand.

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:26.080
Don't be too nervous.

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:28.920
Do you remember...

00:03:28.921 --> 00:03:30.600
our club's social gathering?

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:33.440
You were forced to sing three songs.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.000
Did you know?

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:36.760
The guys were going
crazy over you...

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:38.960
and discussing you
behind your back.

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:41.360
That's when I noticed you.

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:44.200
Don't bring that up.

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:45.880
It was so awkward.

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:47.799
I remember after the performance,

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:49.000
I lost a necklace.

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:50.160
I know about that.

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:53.200
You were looking for it backstage
and asked me about it.

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:56.800
Oh, right.

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:58.840
You helped me look for it
for a long time.

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:02.360
But I didn't manage to find it
in the end.

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:04.680
Out with the old, in with the new.

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:06.520
Speaking of which,

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:08.120
I haven't been back
to the school in a long time.

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:10.080
Me too.

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:13.200
Let's go today then.

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:18.799
Okay, I'll go to the restroom first.

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:19.800
We'll go when I'm back.

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:21.120
Okay.

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:49.640
This necklace must be expensive.

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:51.680
Da Huan never accepts
such expensive things.

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:53.280
It's you.

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:54.920
What's wrong?

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:57.039
Can't I give her a present?

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:59.840
Sure, but I'm accepting it
on behalf of my sister.

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:01.800
After all, Da Huan and I are family.

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:04.080
You're such a busybody.

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:05.280
You don't have to be polite with me.

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:06.640
I'll just say one thing.

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:08.680
Stay away from Jin Da Huan.

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:10.000
What era are we in now?

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:12.880
Da Huan should have
the right to choose.

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:16.280
If you really love her,

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:19.320
you should respect
how she really feels.

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:24.280
What if she's longing to marry me?

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:26.400
I don't care what she thinks.

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:28.920
I hope you don't stoop too low.

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:31.240
Respect her.

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:43.640
Let's go.

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:49.560
What's wrong?

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:51.120
You don't look well.

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:54.280
I'm fine. Your brother was here.

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:01.320
Well? You've had a long day.

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:02.880
This is nothing.

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:07.880
Okay, I'll transfer it to you later.

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:09.200
Let's continue tomorrow.

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:10.360
Again?

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:11.680
Are you crazy?

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:13.080
I'm willing to.

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:15.400
Jin Da Xi.

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:20.280
Hand it over.

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:24.000
Hand what over?

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.160
Are you going to keep pretending?

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:29.840
What are you talking about?

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:33.079
Why did you take the thing...

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:34.080
that Yu Cheng gave me?

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:37.679
Yes, I told you not to do that.

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:39.520
Where did you put it?
Give it to her.

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:42.960
Did you leave it in the shop?

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:44.080
Let's go get it now.

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:46.480
Da Huan, the situation
is a bit unusual.

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:47.840
Let me apologize to you first.

00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:49.360
I'll explain it to you another day.

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:51.600
Let's go.

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:54.600
Da Huan, we'll get it back
for you right away.

00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:02.760
What era are we in?

00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:04.960
Da Huan should have
the right to choose.

00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:13.160
Tong Sheng, what are you looking at?

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:17.320
- Nothing.
- Tong Sheng, are you in love?

00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:19.600
Am I going to have a sister-in-law?

00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:23.920
The choice is up
to the other person.

00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:27.240
Is it Ms. Yan?

00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:32.040
I can come and go freely now.

00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:33.520
You don't have to visit me
every day.

00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:36.080
It's okay. I just like
to bring you food.

00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:37.480
Thank you.

00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:39.400
I'll leave it here. I'll get going.

00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:51.879
Your department store
has been busy...

00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:53.360
with the merger and acquisition
of Xuebao Group, right?

00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:56.440
Yes, and we've been working
overtime every night.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:58.920
But luckily,
we're in the final stage.

00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:02.400
Once it is over,
we'll be one family.

00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:05.080
Give me a moment.

00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:19.200
The coffee here...

00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:21.120
tastes exactly like the one
we had at school.

00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:23.680
I remember you loved their coffee.

00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:26.480
You still remember that?

00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:30.240
Da Huan.

00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:32.560
Are you happy being with me?

00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:36.280
I'm quite happy.

00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:39.400
Then...

00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:41.600
Then can you accept my gift?
