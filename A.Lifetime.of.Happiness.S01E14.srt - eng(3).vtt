(Episode 14)

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:24.440
There's something
I want to tell you.

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:27.440
Da Huan.

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:45.200
So...

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.080
you're my brother, Da Xi?

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:54.680
You're Tong Sheng from Xuebao Group?

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:00.160
After the accident,

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:03.280
you were the one who lived with me.

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:05.720
Then...

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:07.600
it became Da Xi?

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:11.760
And then...

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.120
you again.

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:18.240
I'm sorry.

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.640
I came here to find out...

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:21.960
the truth about my family,

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:23.960
but I didn't expect you...

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:26.880
to be braver than I imagined.

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:31.560
No wonder.

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:35.520
Not only can you speak French,
but you also know everything.

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:37.920
Also...

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:40.680
You two went through
a series of indescribable events.

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:09.120
You're awake.

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:12.840
Da Xi.

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.800
It's me. Are you all right?

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:18.200
Where's Tong Sheng?

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:19.840
He left.

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:21.720
He left?

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:23.600
Why did he leave?

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:25.040
He doesn't even live here.

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:26.040
So why is he here?

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:31.600
Do you want him to take care of you?

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:33.680
No.

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:35.360
Do you miss him?

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:43.960
Why don't you just tell me?

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:47.440
Didn't I tell you yesterday?

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:50.560
I wanted you to talk to me alone.

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:56.120
I'm already sick
and you're still teasing me.

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:58.120
Your act isn't convincing at all.

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:04.480
You've known all along that
Da Xi isn't really your brother.

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:09.800
Da Xi...

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.960
was brought home from an orphanage
by my mom when I was a child.

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.000
I've always treated him
as my real brother.

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:19.520
But he's actually my brother.

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:22.640
I can't believe Da Xi...

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:25.240
is the Tong family's lost child.

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:28.040
I only found out recently.

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:31.320
My dad has been
secretly searching for him...

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.760
and this was kept
from both me and Tong An.

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:35.720
So now,

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:37.680
can you stop...

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:41.199
Wanqi and Xuebao's collaboration?

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:42.200
Don't worry.

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.320
I'll take care of the rest.

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:47.400
Although I haven't
fully regained my memory,

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:48.720
but I promise...

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:51.200
I won't let what happened
yesterday happen again.

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:53.880
And I'll never let anyone
bully you again.

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:56.440
But you have to promise me too.

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:58.520
No matter
what happens in the future,

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:00.160
don't rush into things first.

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:01.840
Remember.

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:03.360
You still have me.

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:07.720
I've already sent someone...

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:09.560
to deal with Bai Yu Chen.

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:11.959
Deal with him? How?

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:13.000
Don't worry.

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:14.960
It's nothing more than
giving him what he deserves.

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:17.720
His affairs have been made public...

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:20.720
and his reputation
should be in ruins by now.

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:23.440
Have a good rest.

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:25.480
Don't worry about the rest.

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:28.640
Da Xi.

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:32.960
Tong Sheng.

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:34.440
What's wrong?

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:37.520
It's nothing.

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:39.560
Get some rest.

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:40.840
I'll be back soon.

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:51.680
Dad.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.600
Why did you put the merger on hold?

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:56.320
With all the commotion
you caused at the press conference,

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:58.480
I have to think it over again.

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:00.240
Also,

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:03.200
the new legal advisor you hired...

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:05.160
has made a complete mess.

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:08.400
There was even scandalous news
at the press conference.

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:10.480
How is this acceptable?

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:13.200
I need to reassess everything,

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:15.799
so the project is on hold.

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:17.760
- Dad, it's not like that.
- By the way,

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:20.720
how is Tong Sheng recovering?

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:23.400
I plan to let him take over.

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:26.600
He's doing well.

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:29.800
There's no conflict
between you two, right?

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:31.600
Of course not.

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:33.960
Brothers have to look out...

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:36.640
for each other in many ways.

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:38.480
You need to understand that.

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:40.400
That's for sure.

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:44.200
Okay, that's all.

00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:57.360
Mr. Tong.

00:05:58.080 --> 00:05:59.640
You forced me to do this.

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:10.480
Are you home?

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:11.639
I bought medicine.

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:12.760
I'm almost home.

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:15.080
I want to eat canned fruit.

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:16.680
I'll go buy it now.

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:20.000
Never mind. Buy it next time.

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:21.200
Come back soon.

00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:17.280
Tong Sheng, are you okay?

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:23.160
Tong Sheng.

00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:30.640
I think...

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:32.640
I remember everything.

00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:38.160
Tong Sheng.

00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:40.880
Let's go home.

00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:43.400
Everything is clear now.

00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:45.040
Dad has rushed back from abroad too.

00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:54.760
Chang Ming.

00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:56.520
Tell me about it.

00:07:57.120 --> 00:07:59.480
Dad, I don't know what to say.

00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:02.880
Chang Ming.

00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:04.200
How about I start for you?

00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:05.919
Let's begin with
how Tong Sheng's car...

00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:07.360
was tampered with.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:09.000
No, Dad.

00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:11.280
It was my subordinate who did it.

00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:12.640
I just found out too.

00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:14.160
He has already fled abroad.

00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:16.280
I'm planning to go
overseas myself to bring him back...

00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:17.320
and confront him face-to-face.

00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:19.279
Dad, I honestly
didn't know about this.

00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:20.360
I really didn't know.

00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:21.760
You have to believe me.

00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:22.920
Make it quick.

00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:25.200
I don't want to see Tong Sheng
after tomorrow.

00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:27.040
- Do you understand?
- Yes.

00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:28.440
Keep an eye on Tong Sheng.

00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:30.399
If he shows any signs
of regaining his memory,

00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:31.480
notify me immediately.

00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:33.000
- Yes.
- Chang Ming.

00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:35.000
Let's drop the act
and keep some dignity.

00:08:36.920 --> 00:08:37.920
Chang Ming.

00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:40.320
After Tong Sheng's accident,

00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:43.000
I asked Tong An
to investigate the whole thing.

00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:46.599
Later, you met Jin Da Xi
at the company.

00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:48.080
You manipulated him...

00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:51.360
into signing a contract
that harmed the company's interests,

00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:53.880
forcing me to dismiss him.

00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:55.319
That way,
you could take over the company...

00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:57.760
and collude with Wanqi Group.

00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:00.040
Did I leave anything out?

00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:05.960
Tong Sheng.

00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:09.160
You have to understand me.

00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:12.440
From the moment
Jin Da Xi entered our home,

00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:14.360
Tong An realized...

00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:16.400
we had mistaken him for you.

00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:23.000
However, he advised me
not to expose Jin Da Xi...

00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:26.040
nor to rush into acknowledging him.

00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:29.200
We did this...

00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:32.200
to give you another chance.

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:36.160
I kept waiting for you to stop...

00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:39.120
and willingly admit your mistakes.

00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:45.240
Tong An.

00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:48.560
You really hid it well.

00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:54.520
In the end, I could never
outmatch the Tong family.

00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:56.440
Chang Ming.

00:09:57.040 --> 00:09:59.120
I've always treated you
like my own brother,

00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:00.800
just like Tong An.

00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:02.240
We're all one family.

00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:04.440
I never expected you to be so cruel.
