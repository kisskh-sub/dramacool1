(Episode 3)

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.359
Da Huan, Mr. Qi asked you
to make some coffee for everyone.

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:18.360
Okay.

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:21.640
Can you guys do it?

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.480
We still don't know
what the problem is.

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.680
Great. We've been working
on this project for three years.

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:29.280
We're just going
to hand it to someone else.

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:30.880
Is that it?

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:33.120
I don't care.

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:35.120
Give me an answer tomorrow.

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:36.720
Otherwise, get lost.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.600
- Hurry up and find it.
- Hurry up.

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:40.240
- Take a look at this.
- What's going on?

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:43.399
Maybe there's a problem...

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.519
with the patent technology.

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:46.720
Yesterday, I already...

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:48.400
Be quiet.

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:50.440
Da Huan, what did you just say?

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:55.000
Go on. Speak up.

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:00.560
Mr. Qi,

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.719
what if we collect...

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:04.080
the patent parts...

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:05.960
of these contracts...

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:07.480
and compare and analyze them?

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:10.200
Wouldn't that be more efficient?

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:13.200
You know about this?

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:15.520
I studied law.

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:17.639
My thesis research was...

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.280
on technology intellectual property.

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:22.360
Why don't you take the data...

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:23.720
and study it at home?

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:27.920
Mr. Qi, I don't think
that's appropriate.

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.400
Why not? It's perfect.

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:32.880
Mr. Gao,
go through all the data later,

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:34.480
organize it,
and give Da Huan a copy.

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:35.680
Okay.

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:37.320
Da Huan,

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:38.840
tomorrow.

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.200
It's all up to you.

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:52.600
Why are you back so early?

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:57.000
I had a last-minute job
at the office.

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:58.400
I'm working from home.

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:07.120
I have something
to discuss with you.

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:09.280
Let's talk about it tomorrow.

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:11.160
I'm busy. Don't bother me.

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:28.160
I won't be done
by tomorrow at this rate.

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:30.800
What are you working on?

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:33.800
I told the company...

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.240
that I'll find the loophole
in the two documents.

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.719
But who knew that both documents...

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:39.760
were all in French?

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.760
It'll take me a week
to translate them.

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:43.480
Aren't you the receptionist?

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:44.800
Why are you doing this?

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:48.000
This is the biggest opportunity
I've had in years.

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:50.240
Don't bother me right now.

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:56.360
"Technology Patent Transfer".

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:02.120
This is in French.

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:04.000
How can you read it?

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:08.120
Look at this.

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:09.600
"Invention brevetÃ©e".

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:12.280
It means a patent has been filed.

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:14.600
But here, it was
simply translated as...

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:15.800
"technology patent".

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:18.200
No way.

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:23.080
Did the car crash
give him a gift for languages?

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:24.240
Let me see.

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:26.160
There should be an attachment
in this document that explains it.

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:29.440
Give me that.

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:35.320
Here it is.

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:37.520
Between these two documents,

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:39.399
regarding the process
of applying for the patent...

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:40.400
and the sequence of operations,

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:41.960
the descriptions are different.

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:44.639
The specific situation...

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:46.320
depends on the patent treaty
in France.

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:48.400
Why are you looking at me?

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:51.000
How do you know this?

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:53.560
I don't know.
I just suddenly knew it.

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:56.600
That's great.

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:00.320
You're my godsent savior.

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:02.680
I'm counting on you tonight.

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:08.879
It's all in French.

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:09.920
It's all technical jargon.

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:11.880
The translation software can't
translate it accurately.

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:13.960
I'll do some research with you.

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:35.760
Amazing.

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:36.960
Of course.

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:38.760
You play really well.

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:43.680
Mr. Tong, I see you've recovered.

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:46.320
It's time to go on a blind date
with Ms. Yan tomorrow.

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:49.400
- You're going on a blind date?
- It's not me. It's you.

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:52.319
Chang Ming, let's not
call each other Mr. Tong.

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:53.360
We're at home after all.

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:55.640
It's been over a decade.

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:57.240
Why are you still so formal?

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:59.800
Hold on. What did you just say?

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:02.120
Me? Blind date?

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:04.359
Chang Ming, explain it to him.

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:05.440
Tong Sheng has forgotten.

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:08.640
Tong Sheng, it was Dad
who arranged this marriage.

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:10.760
Dad has been urging us
from overseas.

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:13.160
You've been putting it off
for months.

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:14.560
Then you got into a car accident.

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:17.360
If you still refuse,
the Yan family will be displeased.

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:19.240
After all, Ms. Yan...

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:20.720
is Mr. Yan's precious daughter.

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:22.600
That's right, Tong Sheng.
You should go.

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:25.240
I'm afraid when our old man
comes back from abroad,

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:27.400
we won't have any freedom anymore.

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:31.640
This is too sudden.

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:34.800
You guys keep playing.
I'll get back to work.

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:47.320
Hey.

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:48.560
Show me...

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:51.200
the hospital's surveillance footage
from the day of Mr. Tong's accident.

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:57.000
Yan.

00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:59.360
Is this how you're going
to meet Mr. Tong?

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:01.400
It's so ugly.

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:03.040
You're just a kid. What do you know?

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:05.000
I never wanted
to go on the blind date.

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:06.360
Blind date?

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:07.520
That's so tacky.

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:11.320
Is this really
the fate of our family?

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:13.799
Don't act like an adult.

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:14.800
It's not cute at all.

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:18.080
Besides, if he can
accept me like this...

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:20.320
that's true love.

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:25.920
Yan, I think he's here.

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:29.200
I'll get going.

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:40.080
Ms. Yan.

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:41.960
Hello, that's me.

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:43.240
Have a seat.

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:47.280
What would you like to order?

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:50.880
I'll have this set.

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:52.480
- Okay.
- What about you, sir?

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:54.439
- Steak.
- How well done?

00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:55.440
Medium-well plus.

00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:57.320
Just a moment.

00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:00.559
I've never seen anyone
order a steak medium well plus.

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:01.560
Is that weird?

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:03.520
Shouldn't it be
the standard options?

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:04.879
Medium or medium well?

00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:06.960
I like to order it cooked
a little past medium well.

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:10.600
It looks like you're different
from the rumors.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:12.000
What rumors?

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:14.320
They say you're cold-hearted.

00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:16.080
I didn't expect you
to be so easygoing.

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:18.800
Did I mistake you for someone else?

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:23.680
No.

00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:33.480
- What?
- Wipe off your lipstick first.

00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:36.800
Do you think I'm ugly
the first time you see me?

00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:38.440
I'm not wiping it off.

00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:40.440
Lipstick is made of dead bugs.

00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:49.040
I'm sorry!

00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:04.720
Just now...

00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:07.280
I don't remember anything.

00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:10.120
I don't remember anything either.

00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:12.280
Ms. Yan, I'll get going then.

00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:15.640
What's wrong? What's the matter?

00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:16.880
Shouldn't you give me a ride?

00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:18.520
I don't even know where you live.

00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:21.720
Okay.

00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:24.160
You can go without me.

00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:25.760
I...

00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:31.160
What's so hard about that?

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.560
Yan, he's so childish.

00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:39.080
There you go. See?

00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:45.960
Da Xi.

00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:47.800
Da Xi?

00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:49.960
I have good news for you.

00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:53.480
Da Xi?

00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:55.240
Are you home?

00:08:56.520 --> 00:08:57.520
Da Huan.

00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:01.200
Congratulations on solving
the contract crisis.

00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:02.880
You've been specially transferred
to the Legal Department.

00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:06.320
How did you know?

00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:07.760
I believed you could do it.

00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:14.840
Wait.

00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:16.080
How much did you pay for this?

00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:18.200
Don't worry, it's on me.

00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:06.640
I really didn't expect it.

00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:09.039
Mr. Qi actually promoted me...

00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:10.760
to the Legal Department...

00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:13.480
in front of the whole office.

00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:16.200
Do you know?

00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:17.999
I'm the only one
in the whole company...

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.600
who got this kind of treatment.

00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:23.120
How does it feel?

00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:25.720
It feels so good.

00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:28.039
You have no idea.

00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:29.600
Those people
in the Legal Department...

00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:32.480
used to order me around every day.

00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:35.840
Every time I read a book
on law at the front desk,

00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:38.240
they would just laugh at me.

00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:40.200
You should have
seen their expressions...

00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:44.920
when Mr. Qi
announced the news today.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:50.560
But I still have to thank you.

00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:52.679
If it weren't for you,

00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:54.280
I wouldn't be doing so well.

00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:55.680
I'm glad you're happy.

00:10:56.640 --> 00:10:57.720
I also don't want to see you...

00:10:57.960 --> 00:11:00.280
get up early every day
to do a job you don't like.

00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:02.800
You even have
to do odd jobs at night.

00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:09.560
Why are you looking at me?

00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:14.560
You...

00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:16.600
Sit here.

00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:43.360
Why do I feel
like you're different from before?

00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:44.880
What?

00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:49.319
When I see you, I blush.

00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:51.000
My heart races.

00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:52.880
Do you want to try it?
