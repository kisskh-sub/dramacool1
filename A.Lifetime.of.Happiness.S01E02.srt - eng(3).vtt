(Episode 2)

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.240
Stop drinking. Your face is red.

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:23.400
You're drunk.

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:26.040
Do you think...

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:29.680
I should be here
in the middle of the night?

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:31.640
If it weren't for you,

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:34.840
I'd be sleeping at home.

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:39.960
I'll pay you back.

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:42.680
With what?

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:44.560
It should be easy for me
to make money.

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:46.320
Easy?

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.160
I think you're out of your mind.

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:09.640
Did you pay the electricity bill?

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:12.520
No.

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:21.840
I'm sure my name is Jin Da Xi.

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.440
Why am I here?

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:25.480
And those photos.

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:27.040
Was it a dream?

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:28.720
Or did I hit my head?

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.120
No. I have to go out
and take a look.

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:39.920
Tong Sheng, what are you doing?

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:41.440
I...

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:43.040
You want to get some fresh air?

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.280
Yes.

00:01:45.281 --> 00:01:46.360
Why didn't you tell me earlier?
I'll take you there.

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.280
- Let's go.
- Isn't the door over there?

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:56.040
I've been gone for three days.

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:58.080
Jin Da Huan didn't even call me.

00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:59.880
Tong Sheng, which car
do you want to drive today?

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:01.680
What do you mean?

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.000
These...

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:21.040
These are all mine?

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:22.520
Yes, they're all yours.

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:24.280
You can spend as much as you want.

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:26.400
Forget it.

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:28.400
You just had an accident.
Let me drive you.

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:32.840
Tong Sheng, what are you
waiting for? Get in.

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.120
Forget it. It's been a while
since I had a good dream.

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:37.560
Let's go.

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:41.360
It doesn't seem nutritious at all.

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.000
I haven't scolded you yet.

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:44.560
Why did you waste money?

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:46.480
("The Spirit of Laws: Volume Two")

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:48.840
You studied law?

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:51.920
When will you regain your memory?

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.120
I graduated from law school.

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:55.920
Then why are you a receptionist?

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:58.520
Because I want to.

00:02:58.521 --> 00:03:00.160
You don't seem to like it.

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:04.640
Mind your own business.

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:07.680
It's because you didn't
pass the bar exam, right?

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:13.319
I was discriminated against
in my major.

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:14.799
Even if I had passed the bar,
no one would have wanted to hire me.

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:17.240
So I can only work at the office
as a receptionist, okay?

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:18.480
Why was it a major?

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:20.000
Is it because
you were not smart enough?

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:26.160
You can't even shut your mouth
when you're eating?

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:28.280
I'm telling you. I'm trying my best.

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:30.280
I have to go to cram school
after this.

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:31.920
I don't see the point.

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:45.080
- Where are you going?
- I'm going to the firepit.

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:47.960
Don't worry. I'll pay you back.

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:49.520
I thank you.

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:58.960
You're here.

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:05.560
Why the long face?

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:08.120
Things didn't go well.

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:10.080
Tong Sheng didn't die.

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:12.000
He's in the hospital now.

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:15.200
You're an adopted son
and still call him your brother?

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:17.520
Mr. Qi.

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:20.240
Don't talk if you're not going
to do something about it.

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:30.040
Okay, Mr. Chang.

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:31.560
You can do whatever you want.

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:54.240
Are you off work?

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:55.880
I ordered food.
I'll wait for you to come back.

00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:59.720
Okay, I'm almost home.

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:08.200
Pretty lady, are you alone?

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:10.079
We've been watching you.

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:11.519
Give us your contact number.

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:12.520
Who are you?

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:14.320
My brother likes you.

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:15.679
He wants you to go
for a drink with us.

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:17.400
How about it?
Come have a drink with us.

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:18.640
What do you want?

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:20.440
You can't tell?

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:22.000
I'll call the police
if you don't stop.

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:23.720
Call the police?

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:25.520
How can you do that
without your phone?

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:31.960
Are you hitting on girls?

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:34.280
It's going to cost you.

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:36.720
Look at how you're dressed.

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:38.200
You're acting like gangsters.

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:39.520
Are you trying to be a hero?

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:42.160
Hey, I think
it's Young Master Qi.

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:44.239
- Let's...
- Let's go.

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:45.240
Let's go.

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:50.560
They're all gone.

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:54.360
Are you all right?

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:00.000
Mr. Qi.

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:02.240
Do you know me?

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:06.360
I remember now.

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:08.920
You're the receptionist
of my company, right?

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:30.680
- Why aren't you home yet?
- Who are you?

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:33.600
Where's my sister?

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:35.600
You're looking for your sister?

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:38.600
Your sister is taking a shower.

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:49.920
Don't come out so late next time.

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:51.520
There are a lot of bad guys
out there.

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:55.280
You're lucky to have met me today.

00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:59.040
Thank you so much, Mr. Qi.

00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:04.120
No one has ever thanked me before.

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:06.600
All right. Get some rest.

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:07.760
I'll get going.

00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:17.760
Hello?

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:21.240
Da Xi?

00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:31.200
Why's Da Xi's phone location
at where my phone is?

00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:36.480
Why did you come out again?

00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:38.760
Mr. Qi, my brother
might be in trouble.

00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:40.920
Let's go and take a look.

00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:31.160
No one will bully you anymore.

00:08:56.960 --> 00:08:58.760
You mean Tong Sheng
has a younger brother?

00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:00.720
They've been separated
for many years?

00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:02.760
It's so complicated.
There's another person.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:05.999
If you had gotten rid of Tong Sheng,

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:07.840
there would only be
a silly Tong An left.

00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:09.640
Now there's another one.

00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:11.040
It's even more difficult.

00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:13.320
What are you going to do now?

00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:18.480
All right. Think about it yourself.
I'm going out for some air.

00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:24.680
Leave Jin Da Xi to me.

00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:29.960
Okay, please wait.

00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:38.360
Mr. Qi.

00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:45.520
You forgot your clothes
from last night.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:51.000
How's your brother?

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:52.000
He's fine.

00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:01.760
Wait for me after work.
I'll take you home.

00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:02.800
It's a deal.

00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:11.640
Your house is nice.

00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:14.000
I didn't notice it last night.

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:15.640
It's almost like a botanical garden.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:17.440
This was my parents' house.

00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:19.880
Do they live with you now?

00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:23.240
They're not around anymore.

00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:25.880
I'm sorry.

00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:29.280
Da Xi.

00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:34.640
Mr. Qi, this is my brother, Da Xi.

00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:38.320
Hi, brother.

00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:40.080
Who's your brother?

00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:41.680
What's with your attitude?

00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:53.480
They are exactly the same.

00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:56.360
What's exactly the same?

00:10:57.400 --> 00:10:58.520
Nothing.

00:10:58.920 --> 00:10:59.920
You're crazy.

00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:02.880
Mr. Qi.

00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:05.040
Mr. Qi.

00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:07.720
I'm sorry. My brother is a bit rude.

00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:08.920
It's okay.

00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:11.640
Is he your biological brother?

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:15.000
What's wrong?

00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:17.000
Nothing. He's cute.

00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:19.280
I'll treat you to a meal later.

00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:21.240
I'll get going. Bye.

00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:31.719
That was my boss.

00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:33.040
Why were you so mean to him?

00:11:40.520 --> 00:11:42.720
What's wrong? Who pissed you off?

00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:50.520
Have you ever thought...

00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:51.960
that I'm not your brother?
