00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.920
(Episode 8)

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:25.280
Why are you here?

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:30.320
I know who you are now.

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:32.520
I got caught again.

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:35.160
All right.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.480
Actually, I'm just a playful person.

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:41.800
You're not Tong Sheng,
you're Jin Da Xi.

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.080
This is what you spent...

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:48.000
pretending to be
Tong Sheng at home.

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:50.920
It's 363,500 yuan in total.

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:54.040
So, how are you going
to pay it back?

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.000
If you really can't pay it back,

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:00.800
I can call the police right now...

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:02.160
and sue you for fraud.

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:06.520
But I can also
give you another option.

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:08.040
What... What is it?

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:09.440
Work with me.

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:13.320
Follow my wishes and continue
pretending to be Tong Sheng...

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.080
and live in luxury.

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:18.200
I can give you some money
when the matter's done,

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.160
and you can take your sister
to go far away.

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:22.960
You can go wherever you want.

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:24.840
I... I'll choose the second option.

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:27.480
Great.

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:29.960
I hope you'll stay at home
from now on.

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:31.280
Don't cause any trouble.

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:34.560
Also,

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:37.680
don't tell anyone
about our conversation.

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:39.600
It'll be our secret.

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:41.680
Got it.

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:47.520
By the way, one more thing.

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.440
Stay away...

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:52.040
from Ms. Yan.

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:53.360
You like her too?

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:58.360
Have you gone stupid
from all the acting?

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Who do you think you are?

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:02.680
You don't deserve
to date Ms. Yan Yan.

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:06.360
I'll call her now.

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:08.320
Break up with her.

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:15.680
Hello?

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:16.680
Yan Yan?

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:18.040
This is Tong Sheng.

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:22.360
Why are you calling me
using this number?

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:24.480
Let's not see each other again.

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.040
If we meet, let's just pretend
not to know each other.

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:28.840
Wait, what?

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:35.440
Good. You're very obedient.

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:34.440
What are you doing here
instead of delivering fish?

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:36.400
I quit.

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:37.520
You quit?

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.720
I quit my job at the fish market.

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:40.880
I'm not delivering fish anymore.

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:42.680
That's fine too.

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:45.520
I also think
you should get a proper job.

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:47.560
You can't keep doing odd jobs.

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:50.720
I want to know what other abilities
I have either,

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:52.320
besides language.

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:53.720
Ability?

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:57.400
Are you out of your mind?

00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:59.280
Do you think you're Iron Man?

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:00.400
Maybe I am.

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:03.999
All right, tell me then.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.240
How do you plan
to get your super power back?

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:11.760
I know, maybe there's a place...

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:13.080
that can help me regain
my lost memories.

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:14.800
Where?

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:16.000
(Success Stories of Chinese
and Foreign Celebrities)

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:22.960
So, Iron Man, have you found it?

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.480
Do you know how to do
postpartum care too?

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:36.240
No.

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:39.320
Why are you reading it so seriously?

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:41.000
How will I know
if I don't look hard?

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:42.560
Maybe it's all hidden
in the details.

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:50.520
(Chinese Literature,
Asian and African Literature)

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:58.840
How does it feel
to lose your memories?

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:02.680
It's like waking up...

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:04.720
and being in an unknown place.

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:08.440
I don't get it.

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:11.200
Do you want to experience it?

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:13.640
How?

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:17.800
Sir, can I borrow your bike?

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:32.480
Hop on.

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:33.480
Why?

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:35.280
Hop on.

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:38.320
Here?

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:49.600
Close your eyes.

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:50.640
What?

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.000
Close them.

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:54.600
Hold on tight.

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:01.720
Slow down. It's really scary.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.080
I'm going to find out
who this woman is.

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:23.320
Open your eyes.

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:28.559
(Slow)

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:29.560
Where are we?

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:31.280
Have we been riding for a long time?

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:33.520
This is how it feels.

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:35.240
Once I opened my eyes,

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:36.840
I don't know where I am.

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:39.040
And I don't know how I got here.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
It's scary when you think
about it that way.

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:01.120
I'm not going to work in Shanghai.

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:06.080
That's not right.

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:08.280
That's impossible.

00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:11.440
Is my offer not good enough?

00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:13.680
Nice.

00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:19.680
How can anyone turn down this offer?

00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:21.520
She definitely won't turn me down.

00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:24.520
What exactly is the problem?

00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:26.960
I'm sure there's no problem.

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:30.440
Are you talking to me?

00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:34.280
- What did you say?
- What are you doing?

00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:35.800
Why do you keep looking
at your phone?

00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:43.440
I've decided.

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:45.720
I won't hang out with you anymore.

00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:49.480
I'm going to turn over a new leaf.

00:07:55.640 --> 00:07:57.080
What's wrong with everyone today?

00:07:57.120 --> 00:07:58.520
Did they forget
to take their medicine?

00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:15.600
What exactly am I thinking?

00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:32.360
This won't do.

00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:34.320
I have to ask him clearly today.

00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:37.600
I have to clear things up.

00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:47.760
Clear what up?

00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:54.200
We're siblings.

00:08:55.720 --> 00:08:57.480
Isn't that my line?

00:08:58.120 --> 00:09:00.520
But I can promise you,
my true identity...

00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:01.720
is not Jin Da Xi.

00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:03.880
What are you talking about?

00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:06.160
That way, maybe you
won't be so troubled.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.200
I... I don't care
if you're Jin Da Xi or not.

00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:12.360
Anyway, I won't like you.

00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:18.640
What exactly am I saying?

(Xuebao Biotech Industrial Park)

00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:25.520
Why didn't you answer my call?

00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:46.240
Sign it.

00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:47.600
Me?

00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:49.160
Should I read it?

00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:51.680
What's there to read?
Can you understand it?

00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:53.240
Sign it now.
