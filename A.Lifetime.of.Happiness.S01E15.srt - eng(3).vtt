00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:13.840
(Episode 15)

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.240
In the end, I could never
outmatch the Tong family.

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:21.360
Chang Ming.

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.840
I've always treated you
like my own brother,

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:25.880
just like Tong An.

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:27.360
We're all one family.

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:29.360
I never expected you to be so cruel.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.080
Family?

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:50.680
In the company,

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:53.200
I didn't even dare
call you "brother".

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.160
You call this family?

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:00.760
When we were kids,

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.320
the three of us went out playing...

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:06.440
and got into trouble.

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:08.880
You were always
the first to scold me.

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:10.920
You call this family?

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.320
And Chang Ming...

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:19.759
This name was given
to me by the orphanage...

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:21.520
after they found me.

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:24.000
I hate those who abandoned me.

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.280
I despise this name.

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:30.280
I begged you repeatedly
to change my surname to Tong,

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:33.240
but you always gave me
all sorts of excuses.

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:36.360
You told me not to forget my roots.

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.000
You were afraid people
would get the wrong idea.

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:40.080
Is this really what family is?

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:44.320
Look at this house.

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:46.640
It's filled...

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:49.040
with photos
of Tong An and Tong Sheng.

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:51.080
Is there even one of me?

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:56.880
Is there?

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:58.560
None at all.

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:01.480
And you call this family?

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.840
I take care of all the work,

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:09.640
running around for you.

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:12.000
You call this family?

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:16.440
Do you know what outsiders
say about me?

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.000
They say I'm just a dog
the Tong family keeps.

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:23.560
I serve
whoever you tell me to serve.

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:26.800
I attack
whoever you tell me to attack.

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:32.160
Tell me.

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:35.320
Is this one family?

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:38.080
Chang Ming.

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:40.840
It seems that all these years,

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.440
you've suppressed too much hatred.

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:47.640
Yes.

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:49.040
Why?

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:52.400
Why is everything I do wrong?

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:55.160
Why am I treated as inferior?

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:58.320
Why can't you ever acknowledge me...

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.320
when all I want is to prove myself?

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.000
And you, Tong Sheng.

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:07.799
In terms of education
and experience,

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:09.080
how am I any worse than you?

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:11.840
Wanqi Group
is such a great opportunity,

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:13.720
but you refused no matter what.

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:15.680
You said it's to protect the brand.

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:18.560
Do you think I don't know?

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:21.520
You secretly transferred
all my people away.

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:23.200
You just wanted to kick me out.

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:26.520
In terms of cruelty,

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:29.440
you're no better.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.000
Back at the company,

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:32.680
I told you countless times...

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:34.120
not to call me Mr. Tong.

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:36.600
You wanted to prove yourself.

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:38.880
You said I transferred
your people away.

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:40.960
Didn't you ever wonder why?

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:45.440
They're all in our new company.

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:48.840
Do you know
who's in charge of the new company?

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:53.760
I've already made a will.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.519
All my assets...

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:00.560
will be divided equally
among my four sons.

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:03.920
But what about you?

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:07.520
After I learned
you wanted to harm Tong Sheng,

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.280
I gave you chance after chance,

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:13.760
but you repeatedly chose...

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:16.320
the cruelest path.

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:20.280
Chang Ming.

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:24.360
Do you remember 10 years ago
when I visited the orphanage...

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:27.320
and saw a little boy being bullied?

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:30.600
He was clutching something
tightly in his arms.

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:32.680
I drove the bullies away...

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:36.440
and saw he was holding
a little rabbit.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.600
You told me you didn't want
to stay in the orphanage...

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:44.760
and wanted to come with me.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.680
You could do anything.

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:53.200
I've treated you
like my own all these years.

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:58.440
Why?

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:02.960
You used to be such a loving child.

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:05.840
But now, you've become so cruel.

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:12.960
Leave.

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:16.800
I'm not your family anymore.

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:25.920
Chang Ming, I've called the police.

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:27.520
They're on their way.

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:35.599
Living in a big house
and driving luxury cars.

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:37.160
That has been your dream
since you were little.

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:39.200
I was just joking.

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:43.359
Don't you want to be rich?

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:44.440
Of course.

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:46.840
I can't leave you alone.

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:48.680
When our parents passed,
I promised them...

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:50.160
that we would take care
of each other.

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:53.920
That Tong Sheng...

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:55.080
is really strange.

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:57.160
After regaining his memory,
he seems like a different person.

00:05:58.320 --> 00:05:59.640
He didn't even ask you out.

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:02.600
Could his mind
have been reset again?

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:03.800
Doesn't he miss you?

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:08.280
Who knows?

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.200
Maybe he recalls that
he has countless girlfriends.

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:17.040
Maybe we won't see each other again.

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:19.760
You're right.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:21.400
He's so indifferent.

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:23.160
It might be better not to see him.

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:29.880
Hello.

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:35.279
Da Huan, wait for me at the door.

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:36.359
I left something at their house.

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:37.600
I'll be right back.

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:45.040
Da Huan, I don't mean to nag.

00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:46.960
You've been living
with him for a few days.

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:48.640
Didn't you notice that he wasn't me?

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:50.960
The doctor said you...

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:52.320
No.

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:53.920
The doctor said
he had lost his memory.

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:55.160
How can I tell?

00:06:57.120 --> 00:06:59.000
Did anything happen between you two?

00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:01.640
What are you talking about?

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:03.240
I heard everything.

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:05.280
He went to your office...

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:07.160
and admitted
that he's your boyfriend.

00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:09.920
Don't bring it up.

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:12.880
He even rode a tricycle
to pick me up from work.

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:15.640
My colleagues
thought he was my boyfriend.

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:17.760
I had to explain for a long time.

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:20.640
What if he doesn't want to explain?

00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:24.920
What did you say?

00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:38.800
I said I don't want you to explain.

00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:43.680
Don't you get what I mean?

00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:48.120
Maybe we won't see each other again.

00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:49.280
You're right.

00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:50.920
He's so indifferent.

00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:52.880
It might be better not to see him.

00:07:58.240 --> 00:07:59.320
Hey.

00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:00.519
Do me a favor.

00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:01.680
Let's switch our identities for now.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:03.040
I need to talk to your sister.

00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:15.839
No wonder
you're acting strange today.

00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:16.960
Jin Da Huan.

00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:19.800
I like you.

00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:22.000
Not the way a younger brother
likes an older sister...

00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:23.960
and not like ordinary friends.

00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:31.320
You have the exact
same face as Da Xi.

00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:34.160
I grew up with Da Xi.

00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:37.000
It has never crossed my mind...

00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:38.720
to see you as just any other man.

00:08:39.920 --> 00:08:41.080
Then just think of it that way.

00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:43.760
How about
we start dating this month?

00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:48.840
See if you can stop treating me
like a little brother.

00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:51.040
If it doesn't work,
you can just return me.

00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:53.440
Return you?

00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:55.760
Do you think I can return you
like some online purchase?

00:08:57.840 --> 00:08:59.400
So you're turning me down?

00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:08.240
I'll take that as a yes.

00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:09.640
It's a deal.

00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:12.080
Let's go.
Da Xi is waiting for us at home.
