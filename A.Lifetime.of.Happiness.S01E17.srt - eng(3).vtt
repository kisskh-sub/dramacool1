00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:13.640
(Episode 17)

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:18.320
Da Xi.

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:25.600
Da Xi.

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:30.480
Da Xi!

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:34.800
Da Xi!

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:40.760
Da Xi.

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:42.120
Da Xi, is it you? Da Xi.

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:43.440
Da Huan.

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:21.760
Da Huan.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.920
The accident happened
because Da Xi took my place.

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:28.680
I owe him for that.

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:32.720
But you have
to stop torturing yourself.

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.040
Tong Sheng.

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:46.880
Let's break up.

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:15.800
Chang Ming has been caught
by the police,

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:16.920
and he confessed to his crime.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.520
But Da Xi is still missing.

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:21.960
We're doing our best to find him.

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:25.400
I see.

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.040
Tong Sheng, I don't blame you.

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:00.360
But...

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:03.360
you look exactly like Da Xi.

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:05.520
Seeing you...

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:08.000
reminds me of Da Xi.

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:10.640
So,

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:14.120
it's better if we don't
see each other again.

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:56.760
(General provisions,
Modification of the contract)

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:12.840
Mr. Qi.

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:14.320
Why are you here?

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:17.759
Wait, don't tell me
you haven't had a proper meal...

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:19.280
since you came back
from the hospital.

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:20.800
I've eaten.

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:26.200
Here, eat my meal first.

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:27.880
Eat it while it's hot.

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:31.920
I'm not hungry. Thank you, Mr. Qi.

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:34.400
Hey.

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:37.920
Your former boss
personally brought you food.

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:39.760
You can at least
do this much for me.

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:42.360
Eat up.

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:45.920
Thank you, Mr. Qi.

00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:58.440
Look at your house.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:00.280
It doesn't look like a home anymore.

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:10.240
This won't do.

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:11.680
I can't stand it anymore.

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:55.560
I'm exhausted.

00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:57.840
I'm the son of the Qi family.

00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:00.120
Now I'm like a manservant.

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:08.040
Mr. Qi, thank you.

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:16.120
Da Huan, I know you must be sad now.

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:18.080
But you have
to pull yourself together.

00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:19.640
Look at you.

00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:22.080
Da Xi would be sad
to see you like this.

00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:32.160
Have you been in touch
with What's-His-Name lately?

00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:39.600
What's going on between you two?

00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:45.880
Actually,

00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:49.960
I really miss him.

00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:56.560
But whenever I think of him,
I think of Da Xi.

00:07:57.120 --> 00:07:58.120
I...

00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:00.560
I can't see him at all.

00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:04.600
I don't think
we can be together anymore.

00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:11.440
But he's still the one you want
to be comforted by the most.

00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:12.800
Right?

00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:23.480
I'm not involved.
Why should I worry?

00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:26.360
Okay, I'm going to go.

00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:28.600
Hey.

00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:30.680
Eat this all up later.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:32.000
Do you hear me?

00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:33.400
This is an order
from your former boss.

00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:36.080
Thank you, Mr. Qi.

00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:39.520
I'm going to go now.

00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:53.000
Tong Sheng, come out!

00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:54.840
Move aside.

00:08:57.760 --> 00:08:59.120
Mr. Tong, I'm sorry.

00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:02.600
Mr. Tong,

00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:05.240
you seem to be doing well.

00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:08.280
If I remember correctly,

00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:10.240
a lot of rumors
have already spread...

00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:12.120
about our two companies.

00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:14.800
It's not a good time
for you to come here.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:16.320
Don't give me
that bureaucratic talk.

00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:18.680
I'll just ask you this.
Do you still care about Da Huan?

00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:20.680
Do you know how she is doing lately?

00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:23.120
Since you care about her so much,

00:09:23.560 --> 00:09:24.560
I'll let you have her.

00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:29.760
What did you say?

00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:25.960
I want to eat canned fruit.

00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:27.960
I'll go buy it now.

00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:37.360
Da Huan, I'm going abroad.

00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:39.080
Take care.
