00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:21.800
You wench.

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.280
What gave you the courage
to seduce my husband?

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.360
Here. Take a picture of this.

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:29.199
This is the woman
who seduced my husband.

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:31.160
That's right. She seduced me first.

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.760
- Don't do this.
- Why not?

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:03.360
Because you're my brother.

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:08.920
What if...

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:10.720
I'm not your brother?

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:44.560
(Episode 1)

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:47.280
(One Month Ago)

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.040
Jin Da Xi, go deliver the fish.

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:04.680
Got it.

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:07.560
Mr. Tong, the car is ready.

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:13.760
- Mr. Tong is here.
- Copy that.

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:31.519
Did you go gambling?

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:32.520
No.

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:33.880
Did you go gambling?

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:36.520
How dare you?

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.680
Da Xi, you're just in time.

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:42.640
Were you playing games last night?

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:45.440
The fish we got today
are all rotten.

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:47.040
No, ma'am.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.360
I didn't buy them.

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.239
I went with the boss
to buy meat yesterday.

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:52.240
Ask him if you don't believe me.

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:53.240
That's right.

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:56.400
- Dear, did you hear that?
- Are you sure you bought the meat?

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:57.960
If you dare lie to me,

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:59.720
I'll rip all your hair off.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.360
Do you believe me?

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:17.840
Tong Sheng, why did you leave?

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:19.680
- Mr. Qi will be here soon.
- Send him away.

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:21.759
But they want to buy in...

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:23.160
Do I have to repeat myself?

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:37.800
(April 17, 2023)

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:41.960
Is that him?

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:44.240
Tong Sheng.

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.880
Sir, it's really Mr. Tong.

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:51.280
Please make the arrangements.

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:54.600
Tong Sheng. Are you okay?

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:13.440
Hello. Which room is the patient
who was just in a car accident in?

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:15.120
- It's 303.
- Thank you.

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:42.040
- What are you doing?
- Who are you?

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:43.560
Why did you set me up?

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.000
Where am I?

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:46.720
Are you crazy, Jin Da Xi?

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:47.880
I'm your sister.

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:51.600
Jin Da Xi?

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:53.800
You said my name is Jin Da Xi?

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:55.080
What just happened...

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:56.520
was a stress reaction.

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:58.599
Your brother suffered
a blow to the head.

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:00.000
He might have temporary amnesia.

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:02.800
Doctor, when will he recover?

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:04.240
It's hard to say.

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:05.400
But I suggest...

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:07.000
you take him to a place
he's familiar with.

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:08.680
It will help with his recovery.

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:17.600
We're home.

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:23.360
You still can't remember anything?

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:29.879
Da Xi, take a look around.

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:31.120
See if you remember anything.

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:32.560
I'm going to cook for you.

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:41.920
Da Xi, it's time to eat.

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:50.520
Come on. I'm so tired.

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:01.520
Eat up.

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:04.280
I'll do it myself.

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:11.600
He's so handsome.

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:17.520
What's wrong?

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:18.520
It's very noisy.

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:20.320
It's noisy?

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:23.080
You used to play it louder than me.

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:28.960
This is really nice.

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:33.920
Jin Da Xi, what are you doing?

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:35.480
So my name is Jin Da Xi.

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:36.880
What's your name?

00:06:36.881 --> 00:06:38.440
I'm Jin Da Huan.

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:40.040
I'm your sister.

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:41.760
We grew up together.

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:43.320
You really don't remember?

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:45.600
I grew up with someone like you?

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:50.120
Yes. What do you mean
by someone like me?

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:52.360
I don't want to eat anymore.

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:53.840
Do whatever you want.

00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:55.960
I want to take a shower.
Where's the bathroom?

00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:57.680
It's upstairs.

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:08.680
Why are you looking at me?

00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:09.880
I'm not interested in you.

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:13.280
What are you talking about?

00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:15.279
- Then why did you look at me?
- What are you thinking about?

00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:16.280
I want to take a shower.

00:07:16.281 --> 00:07:17.840
Then why did you strip
in front of me?

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:19.120
Aren't you my sister?

00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:50.120
The doctor said going back
to your old life...

00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:52.080
would help you regain your memory.

00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:54.160
I'm having your old one repaired.

00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:55.680
I borrowed you a new one.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:58.000
I'm a deliveryman?

00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:00.320
You deliver fish.

00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:03.320
How could I be delivering fish?

00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:05.680
How could you not deliver fish?

00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:08.200
My hands don't look like
they do this kind of work.

00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:09.680
You used to ride this,

00:08:09.681 --> 00:08:12.080
fetch goods from the fish market,

00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:13.840
and deliver them
to this restaurant every day.

00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:15.560
You don't remember?

00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:22.360
Your phone is broken.

00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:23.800
Use my old one first.

00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:26.160
If you need money,
the family card is in there.

00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:27.719
All your old addresses...

00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:28.720
are in there too.

00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:30.160
I'm going to work.

00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:47.920
Where am I?

00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:49.880
Tong Sheng, you're finally awake.

00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:53.880
Who are you?

00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:55.400
I'm your brother, Tong An.

00:08:56.440 --> 00:08:58.560
Mr. Tong, your brother
is recovering well.

00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:00.000
He should be fine.

00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:01.760
He's been in a coma for too long.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:03.360
It might have affected his memory.

00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:05.680
Mr. Tong.

00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:07.280
You're the president
of Xuebao Group.

00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:10.960
That's right, Tong Sheng. Look.

00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:12.280
This is a photo of us
when we were kids.

00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:15.840
That's me?

00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:16.960
Tong Sheng.

00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:19.160
You don't even recognize me.

00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:20.560
Maybe you really have amnesia.

00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:23.040
Maybe I'm dreaming.

00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:36.640
- Hello?
- Hello, Da Xi.

00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:39.040
I ordered a cake for you
to celebrate your discharge tonight.

00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:41.440
Buy some groceries on your way back.

00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:42.720
I'll send you the list.

00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:45.240
If you see anything you need,

00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:46.400
you can buy it on your way back too.

00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:49.960
- Hello.
- Hello.

00:09:49.961 --> 00:09:51.240
Jin Da Huan, right?

00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:53.040
- That's me.
- Here's the cake you ordered.

00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:54.480
Thank you.

00:09:56.760 --> 00:09:58.480
(Payment Notification)

00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:01.840
(Payment Notification)

00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:07.040
Jin Da Xi.

00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:10.520
Jin Da Xi.

00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:32.240
You're back.

00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:38.280
What's this?

00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:40.240
I've been wearing the clothes
in the closet for five years.

00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:41.440
I got some new ones.

00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:46.720
What's this?

00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:52.560
Don't you already have one?

00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:54.600
The one in the bathroom
isn't my favorite brand.

00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:06.480
I'm afraid my boss
will deduct my pay if I'm late.

00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:08.760
Jin Da Xi.

00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:10.000
You want to die, don't you?

00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:12.120
Didn't you tell me
to buy something I like?

00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:15.400
Did you look at the price
when you bought it?

00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:16.840
Are you out of your mind?

00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:19.240
Don't you know what our family's
financial situation is like?

00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:21.280
I don't think it's expensive.

00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:22.840
It's not expensive?

00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:26.760
It's 70,000 yuan
and you say it's not expensive?

00:11:27.640 --> 00:11:29.360
Do you know how hard it is for me
to save money every day?

00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:30.720
You spent it all in a flash.

00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:32.280
Who do you think you are?

00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:33.680
Are you some young master?

00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:35.440
You're right.

00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:36.999
There was a moment
when I was shopping...

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:38.519
that I thought
I should be a rich kid...

00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:39.840
or the owner of a company
or something.

00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:44.720
- Why do I have a brother like you?
- Right.

00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:46.640
Here's yours.

00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:49.600
You've been wearing those shoes
for almost 3 to 4 years.

00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:50.840
Wear these.

00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:55.240
What era are we in?

00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:56.520
How are there still
power outages here?

00:11:56.800 --> 00:11:58.800
I was going to pay
the electricity bill,

00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:00.840
but you spent all the money.

00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:01.880
What should we do?

00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:04.720
There's some loose change
at the door.

00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:06.080
Go and pay the electricity bill.

00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:13.240
I bought drinks.

00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:14.560
They are all gone.
