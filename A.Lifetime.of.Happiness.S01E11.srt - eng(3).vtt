(Episode 11)

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.759
Go. Get me out of here now.

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:33.639
- What's going on? What happened?
- There's no time to explain.

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:35.440
I don't know either,
I'm being controlled.

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.879
No, I was hit by a car.

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:39.920
And when I woke up,
I was a different person.

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:41.280
And then there is...

00:00:41.281 --> 00:00:42.920
someone who looks exactly like me.

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.040
Like a clone.

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:45.360
Not really.

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:47.080
It's like I'm the clone.

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:49.039
I don't know how to explain it.

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:50.279
It's just really, really ridiculous.

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:51.520
Like a sci-fi movie.

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:52.800
Do you get it?

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:54.080
I get it.

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:55.840
You do?

00:00:55.841 --> 00:00:57.000
I don't even know what I'm saying.

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.199
Jin Da Xi, I've thought
things through. I...

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:00.520
How do you know
my name is Jin Da Xi?

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.360
There's someone
you should probably meet.

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.399
And this time,

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.840
we must get it done.

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:12.160
And you...

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.160
have to be confident, okay?

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:19.720
I'll drive you home.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.760
It's okay. Don't bother.

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:27.200
I'll take her home.

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:30.520
You are...

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:34.160
This is my little brother, Da Xi.

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:36.400
Your little brother?

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:39.080
I've heard you mention him.

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:42.240
He's all grown up,
and he's quite handsome.

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:45.120
- Let's go.
- I'll drive you guys home.

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:46.440
There's no need.

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:11.920
Where's Yu Chen?

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:14.080
You should be more careful.

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:15.600
You can't tell good from bad people.

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.000
Stay away from him from now on.

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:19.720
Yu Chen?

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.040
How can he be a bad person?

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:24.760
Shut up.

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:26.240
I don't want to hear it.

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:35.520
Who...

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:37.720
exactly are you?

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:44.880
I'll tell you in the future.

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:01.560
Why are you back?

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:02.760
The situation has changed.

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:07.600
That's what happened.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.000
I swear.

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:11.440
At first, I was just curious
and my sister...

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:14.600
Anyway, I didn't do it on purpose.

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:16.800
And I was forced to do it later on.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.079
So that guy Chang Ming...

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:20.200
has been pulling tricks
behind our backs.

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:23.039
Of course. He obviously
doesn't look like a good person.

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:24.440
Why do you believe
everything he says?

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:26.480
Is that so?

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.320
Why would someone do whatever
he was told to do back then?

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:34.400
The biggest problem now is that...

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:36.200
even though I know who I am,

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:38.520
I haven't regained my memories.

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:40.440
So I can't be sure...

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:41.880
what Chang Ming is trying to do...

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:44.040
and how the company
is really doing.

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:45.760
I have to figure these things out...

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:47.480
to prevent them
from destroying Xuebao Group.

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:49.920
We're brothers.

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:51.959
Why is our gap so big?

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:53.320
I'm like a low-end version.

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:57.560
So what do you plan to do next?

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:59.240
I'm going back
to pretend to be myself.

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:00.400
What do you mean?

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:02.000
You're confusing me.

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:04.200
You mean...

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:06.599
you're going back as Jin Da Xi...

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:08.600
and continue pretending to be
Tong Sheng for him?

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:11.920
That way, I can
gather information myself.

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:15.160
And I might remember more things.

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:18.760
I feel like all
the intelligence I'm missing...

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:20.240
is in you.

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:22.840
That's a good idea indeed.

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:25.280
I have one more favor to ask.

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:30.040
Please take good care of her.

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:32.640
She has a senior named Bai Yu Chen.

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:34.600
Don't let them get too close.

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:38.040
How can I interfere
with my sister's business?

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:39.400
That's not right.

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:43.280
Based on what you're saying,
you mean...

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:44.760
You mean...

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:47.720
You're really slow.

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:48.880
Darn it.

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:52.080
Lower your voice.

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:02.520
Mr. Qi.

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:05.400
Let's settle this matter today.

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:09.760
We're all ready on our side.

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:13.440
Is this why you asked me to come?

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:15.759
I thought I told you...

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:17.080
I wouldn't get involved.

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:22.120
You've been pursuing
Jin Da Huan lately, right?

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:23.600
I don't think...

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:28.120
you want Tong Sheng
to come back either.

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:32.120
This is good for you too.

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:33.720
Right, Mr. Qi?

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:36.560
That is a fair competition
between me and Tong Sheng.

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:39.280
It has nothing to do with you.

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:42.880
All right then.

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:44.560
By the way,

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:46.640
I told your mother
about this matter.

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:48.520
Your mother agrees wholeheartedly.

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:51.200
I don't think it's up to you...

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:52.520
if she personally gets involved.

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:55.000
You're really despicable.

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:57.559
I've found a new team of lawyers...

00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:58.880
to handle this matter.

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:01.280
I hope you will...

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:03.400
cooperate fully when the time comes.

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:48.440
Tong Sheng, you're back so soon.

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:51.880
I've been gone for days.
What did you tell them?

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:53.080
Those people are all gone.

00:06:53.081 --> 00:06:54.439
I've already pleaded with Dad.

00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:55.600
He's not mad at you anymore.

00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:57.439
You're really good.

00:06:57.440 --> 00:06:58.440
Of course.

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:00.120
Can you give me...

00:07:00.121 --> 00:07:01.400
a summary of the company's
latest projects?

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:02.680
The more detailed, the better.

00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:03.920
Okay.

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:05.160
I'll get right on it.

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:22.880
Da Huan, you're awake.

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:26.360
I'm sorry.

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:28.320
I got drunk last night.

00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:30.200
I didn't say...

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.080
or do anything out of line, did I?

00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:34.680
What are you talking about?

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:36.160
I mean,

00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:39.640
nothing happened between us
again last night, right?

00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:42.200
Again?

00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:43.280
What happened between you two?

00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:47.280
"You two?"

00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:50.680
Yes, you and him.

00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:52.280
Me and who?

00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:54.920
Forget it. It's nothing.

00:07:57.320 --> 00:07:58.440
Don't get me wrong.

00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:01.560
Yu Chen and I
are just old classmates.

00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:03.840
Nothing's going on between us.

00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:05.040
Don't overthink it.

00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:07.040
I'm not overthinking it. Wait.

00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:08.680
Why is there another guy?

00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:10.080
What does it have to do with him?

00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:11.320
Anyway,

00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:13.720
I don't want you to misunderstand.

00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:15.440
Misunderstand?

00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:18.160
Da Huan, stop it.
You're making it worse.

00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:19.520
At this rate,
I'll really get the wrong idea.

00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:21.400
I'll get going.

00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:25.280
Where are you going?

00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:27.199
Delivering fish.

00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:28.200
Delivering fish?

00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:30.880
Didn't you quit?

00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:33.080
What else can I do?

00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:34.520
I'll get going.

00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:14.960
Hello?

00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:19.080
Who is this Bai guy?

00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:20.600
What's his relationship with her?

00:09:20.601 --> 00:09:22.240
What a coincidence,
you ran into him too.

00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:25.360
You're so calm, man.

00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:27.400
But I can tell.

00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:29.720
He's not that simple.

00:09:30.760 --> 00:09:32.120
Don't make a mistake now.

00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:33.559
We're on the same side.

00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:34.600
You're quite smart.

00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:35.880
You'll be the lookout then.

00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:38.040
I'm hanging up. Only call me
if something comes up.

00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:40.560
Hello?

00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:44.320
Who do you think you are?

00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:49.240
Why is there another guy?

00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:28.919
Don't you know everything now?

00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:29.920
Why are you still here?

00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:33.240
How can you be so confident
after deceiving me?

00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:35.440
I didn't do it on purpose.

00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:42.240
As you can see,

00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:43.440
this is the real me.

00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:45.240
It stinks, doesn't it?

00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:48.600
Five thousand yuan a day.

00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:50.600
What do you mean?

00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:53.920
I'll help you work
and give you 5,000 yuan.

00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:56.080
Are you crazy?

00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:57.200
Ten thousand yuan.

00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:02.280
Don't regret it.

00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:04.680
Let's go, boss.

00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:09.640
This is really crazy.
