(Episode 13)

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:29.920
What era is this?

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:32.120
Da Huan should have
the right to choose.

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:36.760
Yu Chen?

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:40.560
How could Yu Chen be a bad person?

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:45.360
Da Huan, are you happy
being with me?

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:53.080
What if she's longing to marry me?

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:12.760
Tong Sheng, you haven't been
yourself lately.

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:15.719
Tong Sheng, have you heard...

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:16.920
about the merger and acquisition
of our group?

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:20.880
I don't know
what Chang Ming is thinking.

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:23.560
He's willing to give up
the pricing power.

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:26.760
What?

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:28.840
I remember what you said about
the company's original purpose.

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:30.479
It is to provide the public...

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:32.520
with affordable
and high-quality products.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.040
The products should be
cost-effective.

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:35.640
But looking at how this is going,

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:37.160
the group is going
to change strategies.

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:39.120
Do you also think there's
something wrong with this contract?

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:40.560
I can't explain it either.

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:42.120
But something doesn't feel right.

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:43.560
I can't put my finger on it.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.120
Have you seen the contract?

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:47.600
No, I haven't.

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:49.120
Besides, Chang Ming won't show it
to me.

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.240
I see.

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:54.160
I'll think of a way.

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:55.960
Okay, Tong Sheng.
I'll get going then.

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:57.560
I just came to see you
before I go out.

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:06.280
Jin Da Xi, let's switch identities
tonight.

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:17.520
What are you doing?

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:20.120
I'm working overtime.

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:23.480
It's so complicated.

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:26.760
Xuebao Group?

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.120
Yes. It's the merger
and acquisition.

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:32.800
I don't know why I'm so anxious.

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:34.560
The contract has been signed.

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:36.440
I'm still here researching.

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:40.080
The contract has been filled out?

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:43.599
We'll sign it at the press
conference tomorrow.

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:45.360
All the legal procedures are done.

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:48.440
Then what are you worried about?

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:53.040
I found a problem.

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:54.640
What is it?

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:56.360
Look at these contracts.

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:00.800
Look at this subcontractor.

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:03.840
Is there something
wrong with this company?

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:06.920
I looked into this company.

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:09.239
I found out that this company...

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:10.920
doesn't actually exist.

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:12.560
But it received investments...

00:03:12.561 --> 00:03:15.400
from Xuebao and Wanqi
at the same time.

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:17.160
You went to investigate?

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:18.520
On your own?

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.720
Yes, of course.

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:24.280
I see.

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:26.320
Chang Ming.

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:29.240
I didn't think you'd go this far.

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:31.880
What?

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:33.320
So,

00:03:33.321 --> 00:03:35.520
this company might
just be a shell company.

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:37.920
They exist just to make money
from companies getting listed.

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:40.000
They take advantage
of the merger and acquisition...

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:42.120
and make money
when the stock price rises.

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:43.560
Then they'll announce
their bankruptcy.

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:46.800
Stop it.

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:48.880
What's wrong?

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:50.960
Did you forget
what happened to our family?

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:55.440
Did you forget our dad...

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:03.160
No.

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:06.160
I have to stop this from happening.

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:07.800
If you do that,

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.120
you can never return
to Wanqi Group.

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:11.600
I know.

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:14.560
But I have to do it.

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:17.280
I've made up my mind.

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:18.920
But...

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:20.920
The press conference is tomorrow.

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:24.480
I have an idea.

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:30.760
Esteemed leaders and guests,

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:32.679
the signing ceremony
of Xuebao Group...

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:33.800
has officially begun.

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:36.760
Thank you for coming
to the signing ceremony.

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:39.439
Let's welcome the acting
president of Xuebao Group,

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:41.000
Mr. Chang Ming, to say a few words.

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:44.800
First of all,
thank you all for coming today.

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:46.920
Working with Wanqi Group...

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:49.720
is an important boost
for Xuebao Group.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.080
From now on, our group
will undergo a transformation.

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:54.320
We promise...

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:56.480
to bring better quality products...

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:59.160
with consumer interest in mind.

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:01.760
Let's move on to the interview.

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:06.560
We just received a tip-off.

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:08.639
It states that the purpose
of this merger and acquisition...

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:10.160
is to create a market effect.

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:12.520
It does not benefit
the two companies...

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:15.279
but rather, a third-party
company called Qimingxing.

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:16.680
What's going on?

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:18.680
The document also includes...

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:19.680
evidence of the relevant contract.

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:20.920
Is this all true?

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:23.520
Does Qimingxing really exist?

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:24.999
Or is it just a shell company...

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:26.519
that makes money from
your companies getting listed...

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:27.520
like the document says?

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:29.720
It's a twin contract.

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:31.720
I can't believe it.

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:33.280
I'll go in with you.

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:34.800
It's okay.

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:36.160
Trust me. I can handle it.

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:41.999
Please don't be affected...

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.320
by this irrelevant information.

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:46.280
Please screen these rumors
carefully. They are without proof.

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:47.600
I have proof.

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:54.480
I'm a lawyer from Wanqi Group's
Legal Department.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:56.960
The contract in my hand
can prove it all.

00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:59.560
As you can see,
on page 24 of the contract,

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:01.960
this is the result of my
investigation on Qimingxing Company.

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:04.439
Qimingxing Company...

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:05.959
is a shell company...

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:06.960
that doesn't produce anything.

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:08.360
The contract you see here...

00:06:08.361 --> 00:06:09.680
is just an external contract.

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:11.280
What I have in my hand...

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:13.000
is the real, internal contract.

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:14.800
Give me a moment.

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:16.360
I looked into it.

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:17.760
You have been in charge
of the contract.

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:19.400
I knew that that day,

00:06:19.401 --> 00:06:20.840
you were on your way
to submit the final contract.

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:22.679
So I pretended to run into you...

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:23.680
and had dinner with you.

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:26.920
I've sent the contents
to your phones.

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:28.440
You can check it now.

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:32.200
- It's a twin contract.
- That's right.

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:34.080
Why does she have
the internal contract?

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:38.000
I'm sorry, everyone.
This is an internal problem.

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:39.520
I'll take care of it later.

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:40.880
Miss.

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:42.719
Are you sure
the contract you have...

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:44.040
is valid?

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:46.280
It's obviously a fake contract...

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:48.480
that was fabricated
to slander the Group.

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:54.840
Everyone, look carefully
at the final signature and stamp.

00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:56.920
They're all fake.

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:02.360
I already knew what you were doing.

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:04.480
And I know how you do things.

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:08.240
Miss.

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:10.400
If I remember correctly,

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:12.360
you're just a receptionist, right?

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:13.999
- She's not an employee?
- She's just a receptionist?

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:15.000
She's just a receptionist.

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:16.639
You seduced...

00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:17.880
Mr. Qi of Wanqi Group.

00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:20.039
That's why you had the chance
to join the Legal Department.

00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:21.040
Why is she like this?

00:07:21.041 --> 00:07:22.160
That's nonsense.

00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:23.800
Everything you did...

00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:25.880
- was to frame the group!
- That's right.

00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:29.000
I didn't expect to have a black
sheep like you in our company.

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:31.200
Go to the HR Department
and get your final salary now.

00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:38.160
Here, take a picture of this.

00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:40.880
This is the woman
who seduced my husband.

00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:49.399
Yes, that's right.

00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:50.560
She seduced me first.

00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:56.880
Yes, she seduced me first.

00:07:57.960 --> 00:07:58.960
I can't believe you did this...

00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:00.520
just to get revenge.

00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:01.960
What kind of person are you?

00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:16.960
Is this the kind of person you like?

00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:08.720
Don't do this.

00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:10.400
Why not?

00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:13.120
Because you're my brother.

00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:14.880
What if I'm not?
