(Episode 6)

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.120
Mr. Qi, are you all right?

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:21.480
Why do you look so tired,
as if you didn't sleep at all?

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:26.960
Because I really didn't sleep.

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:29.279
Why didn't you sleep?

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:30.360
Cut the crap and spit it out.

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.240
Well, the chairman is here.

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.040
What?

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:39.080
Mom, why are you here?

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.920
Don't you have anything to tell me?

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.120
What? Nothing.

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:48.480
Everything is fine.

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.840
I heard you've been coming
to the office early lately.

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:52.800
No wonder your dark circles
are swollen like that.

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:57.040
I've been monitoring
attendance lately,

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:59.120
so I figured
I should set an example...

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:01.160
and come in on time, right?"

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.920
If only you could put
the same effort into blind dates.

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:05.919
I've introduced
so many girls to you...

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:07.000
and you didn't like any of them.

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:08.319
It has been so many years.

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:10.200
I don't know
if you've ever dated anyone.

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:12.520
You should at least
bring one home for me to meet.

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:13.960
Come on, Mom.

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:17.040
Have you looked at the people
you've been introducing me to?

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:18.639
How could you say that?

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:20.120
Last time, it was Mr. Wu's daughter.

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:21.840
And the time before that,
it was Mr. Zhao's daughter.

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:24.080
They watched you grow up.

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:25.680
Their daughters
are such fine girls...

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:27.080
and you're still being picky.

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.160
Mom, don't worry.

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:31.400
I'll find someone you're happy with.

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.800
That means there's someone you like.

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:36.240
Whose daughter is she?

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:37.800
You don't need to worry about it.

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:40.000
You have to think carefully.

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:42.560
This isn't just about you.

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.320
All right.

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:46.760
Trust me.

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:48.560
You'll be satisfied.

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:55.520
You never fail to surprise me.

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:57.280
What's wrong?

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:00.360
I didn't expect you to bring me...

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:01.520
to a place like this.

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:03.120
Isn't it nice?

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:04.600
Their skewers are amazing.

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:05.680
Try this.

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:10.720
Will I get diarrhea if I eat this?

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.840
It doesn't seem very clean.

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.760
Is it because
the tables look worn out,

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:22.120
the place is a bit shabby,

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.120
and it's right by the busy street...

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:25.800
that you think...

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:27.520
it's not clean?

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:29.960
Not exactly.

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:38.360
Do you want to hear a story?

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:40.880
Sure.

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:42.400
There was once
a brother and a sister.

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:45.720
Their parents passed away
when the brother was young,

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:48.640
leaving only the sister
to support the family.

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.160
To send her brother to university,

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:53.040
she tried every possible way
to make money.

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:55.160
But the more anxious
she was to earn,

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:56.400
the more easily she was cheated.

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.520
In the end, she lost everything.

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:01.320
She even got into debt.

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:03.760
Exhausted,
she collapsed from overwork.

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:08.000
Her brother had no choice
but to quit school...

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:10.920
and wander around looking
for ways to earn a living.

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:12.880
Every night,

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:14.880
he could only afford to buy
the leftover cabbage at the market.

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:20.560
Later, he met a kindhearted boss.

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:23.800
It's him.

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:26.280
Once he learned
about the siblings' situation,

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:28.280
he provided them
with meals every day.

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:31.240
He even told the brother,

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:33.160
"I don't know how it is elsewhere,"

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:36.480
"but here,
you can eat with peace of mind."

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:41.680
It's exactly
what you're eating right now.

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:44.600
That's why...

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:48.320
you can't judge a restaurant
by its appearance.

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:50.000
It's the same with people.

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:54.400
I didn't know
you could be so philosophical.

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:57.720
And what happened
to that pair of siblings?

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:00.880
They ended up doing quite well.

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:03.240
Talking about this
kind of makes me feel homesick.

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:05.120
Homesick?

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:06.760
Didn't you just leave home?

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:11.520
Forget it.

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:15.040
I can't seem to read you anymore.

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:16.680
What kind of person are you?

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:19.720
I'm certainly
not the same type as you.

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:21.880
Really?

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:23.520
How are you different?

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:27.720
You wouldn't understand.

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:30.160
You wouldn't want
to know my other side.

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:32.920
Don't be so certain.

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:34.720
Why don't you
let me experience it today?

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:38.440
Forget it. You wouldn't want to.

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:41.760
Why are you so sure about that?

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:47.200
Why don't you eat the skewer first?

00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:59.280
Isn't it delicious?

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:01.039
It's surprisingly good.

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:02.160
See? You didn't believe me.

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:04.520
I was wrong.

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:05.680
As punishment,

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:07.520
you'll have to take me out
for more fun after this.

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:09.080
Is this a punishment?

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:11.040
Who's actually paying
the price here, you or me?

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:12.440
So are you taking me or not?

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:13.760
Yes, of course.

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:15.559
I'll make sure you eat
to your heart's content today.

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:16.600
Come on.

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:22.520
If that's all,
then let's call it decided.

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:23.720
Okay, Mr. Qi.

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:30.440
I'll take my leave now.

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:34.600
Da Huan, are you free tonight?

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:35.879
What's the matter, Mr. Qi?

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:37.479
Is there still something
you need me to handle?

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:38.520
No.

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:41.319
I know a really good restaurant.

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:42.440
Let's go together.

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:47.200
I have a lot to do tonight.

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:48.960
Maybe I shouldn't go.

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:51.759
You can deal with it tomorrow.

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:52.800
There's no rush.

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:57.640
Who is that? He's so handsome.

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:06.280
Who are you looking for?

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:07.560
I'm looking for Mr. Qi.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.120
A cup of coffee for me, please.

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:15.520
What are you doing here?

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:16.840
I'm bored at home.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:18.280
- He's so handsome.
- Here's your coffee.

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:19.480
- Da Xi.
- He's so handsome.

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:23.799
You look familiar.

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:25.400
- You are...
- The one on the tricycle.

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:27.240
Yes, that's me.

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:29.640
So you're Jin Da Huan's
boyfriend, right?

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:31.159
Yes.

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:32.320
No.

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:34.000
He's my younger brother.

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:35.920
My younger brother, Jin Da Xi.

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:37.480
- I see.
- Younger brother?

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:40.480
But why is he
wearing Mr. Qi's clothes?

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:43.200
I'm staying at his house now.

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:46.560
He's staying at my house.

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:51.360
No, wait.

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:53.720
What are you thinking?

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:57.400
He's a French tutor I hired.

00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:00.720
He's giving me
private lessons at my house.

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:02.240
Do you get it now?

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:04.000
I see.

00:07:04.001 --> 00:07:05.640
You all have too much time
on your hands, don't you?

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:07.120
Not enough work to keep you busy?

00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:08.399
Do you even want
to get off work on time?

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:09.440
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:12.480
You're so fierce.

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:14.640
Am I?

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:17.200
By the way, what were you
talking about just now?

00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:20.160
Mr. Qi asked me if I wanted
to have dinner with him.

00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:22.080
Sure, let's go together.

00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:23.720
Wait.

00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:25.279
What does this have to do with you?

00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:27.320
I'm your 24-hour personal tutor.

00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:28.800
Of course, I have to do my job.

00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:35.720
So?

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:38.280
How are you adjusting to
staying at Mr. Qi's place?

00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:40.080
It feels strangely familiar.

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:43.200
I must've lived in a house
like that before.

00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:46.160
You're thinking too much.

00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:47.360
Work hard and earn well.

00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:48.559
Maybe someday,

00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:50.360
you'll be living
in a house like that.

00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:53.960
Get in the car.

00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:56.440
Come on. Get in.

00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:02.840
What exactly do you want?

00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:04.120
Nothing. Let's go.

00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:09.399
That's enough.

00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:10.400
Don't push it.

00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:13.960
They're together.

00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:15.560
Look.

00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:19.440
What are you looking at?

00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:25.480
Let's go. Aren't you hungry?

00:08:58.640 --> 00:08:59.760
What do you think?
Does it look good?

00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:08.360
Jin Da Huan,
what are you thinking about?

00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:19.679
Why aren't you wearing anything?

00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:21.360
I'm your brother.
What's there to be afraid of?

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.360
No, I don't want you
to catch a cold.

00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:27.600
This dress suits you. It's pretty.

00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:31.359
Lately, I've been having
these scattered memories...

00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:32.480
popping up in my head.

00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:35.400
Maybe in a few days,
my memory will come back.

00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:37.720
What if I'm not really
your brother...

00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:39.640
but a rich man?

00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:42.680
That's enough. I think
you really did get knocked silly.

00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:44.480
You've been acting strange lately.

00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:46.240
Stop imagining things.

00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:48.160
If I really were a wealthy heir,

00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:49.840
then I'd marry you.

00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:51.879
What nonsense are you talking about?

00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:52.880
I'm hanging up.

00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:16.960
I haven't seen him for a long time.

00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:18.440
That brat.

00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:20.920
I wonder what he's doing
at home every day.

00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:22.360
Mr. Qi.

00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:24.120
- Mr. Qi, are you home?
- Wen Han.

00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:25.920
Wen Han.

00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:33.360
Wen Han.

00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:36.400
Wen Han.

00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:45.600
What did you tell my mom?

00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:53.040
The truth.

00:10:57.640 --> 00:10:58.680
How...

00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:01.079
How long has this been going on?

00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:02.080
It just started.

00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:04.160
But Mr. Qi seems to really like me.

00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:05.600
He asked me to move in
with him right away.

00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:07.080
Does that mean...

00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:09.479
Qi Wen Han, my unfilial son,

00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:10.560
- approached you?
- Yes.

00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:12.480
At first, I turned him down.

00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:13.600
I didn't think it was a good idea.

00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:15.199
But he was too enthusiastic.

00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:16.239
He was persistent.

00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:17.440
It was like
he couldn't wait any longer.

00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:19.640
Is that the truth?

00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:22.360
Sort of.

00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:24.280
But your mom
doesn't seem to like me.

00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:25.600
She wants me to move out today.

00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:27.320
I'm telling you in advance.

00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:28.560
You still have to pay me.

00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:30.640
No. Why do I still have to pay you?

00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:32.360
You asked me to write
the additional clause,

00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:33.640
so I added this clause.

00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:35.560
If any uncontrollable factors...

00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:36.960
cause the service to be terminated,

00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:39.200
Party A shall pay Party B
the full amount of wages.

00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:44.399
(If any uncontrollable factors
cause the service to be terminated,)

00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:45.960
(Party A shall pay Party B
the full amount of wages.)

00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:51.120
You win.

00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:00.120
Mom.

00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:01.400
- Mom.
- You unfilial son.

00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:03.519
Let me explain.
Mom, I have my reasons.

00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:04.999
Mom, I have my reasons.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:06.199
Listen to me first.

00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:07.719
Mom, calm down.

00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:08.720
I have my reasons.

00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:10.080
Calm down, Mom.

00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:12.640
It's not what you think, Mom.
