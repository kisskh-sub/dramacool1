00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.920
(Episode 10)

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:17.640
Tong Sheng, I've finally found you.

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:19.240
How have you been?

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:20.760
I looked everywhere for you.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.320
Are you hurt? Are you okay?

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:24.520
Tong Sheng, I've missed you so much.

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.680
I knew something was off
with that person at home.

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:31.640
I'm sure he's not you.

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:34.720
That's why I checked
the hospital's CCTV footage...

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:38.200
and found out we got
the wrong person that day.

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:41.120
So...

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.520
Jin Da Xi and I are twins.

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.000
Actually, we're all
from the Tong family.

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:48.840
It's a long story.

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:50.560
Although your surnames are Tong,

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:53.280
you're actually adopted like me.

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:54.720
Adopted?

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:57.320
Yes.

00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:58.880
When Dad first started his business,

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.160
it was chaotic.

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:02.800
One of you got lost...

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:04.680
and was adopted
by a kind-hearted man.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.160
That was Jin Da Xi.

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:08.000
But that's not important.

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:09.840
What's important is that...

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:12.800
the Tong family's true heir
is Tong An now.

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:14.920
Tong An?

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:19.600
Tong Sheng, you must have
lost your memories...

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:21.320
and don't remember
these things much.

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:23.600
Since Dad had Tong An,

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:26.240
his attitude towards us changed.

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:28.720
Later on, we became pawns.

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:30.720
Everything we're doing...

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:32.920
is to pave the way for Tong An.

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:35.880
So when I met you again this time,

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:38.200
I wasn't in a hurry
to bring you home.

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:40.680
Because I'm very worried.

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:42.560
I'm worried that Dad will use you.

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:44.920
So I came up with a way...

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:48.200
to get you out of here
through a high salary offer.

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:50.640
But I didn't expect...

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:52.800
that you're not Jin Da Xi.
You're my brother.

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:56.240
Tong Sheng.

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:57.680
Come home with me.

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:04.480
Actually, Tong Sheng,

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:06.320
it's also good
that you've been replaced.

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.560
At least you're out of misery.

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:13.640
Do I get to decide
whether to go back or not?

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:16.440
Yes.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.840
But Tong Sheng, as you know too,

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:21.600
we're both stepchildren.

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:22.880
Over the years,

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:24.880
Dad has done a lot of shady deals
in his business.

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:28.840
Eventually, Dad will surely
set up a trap...

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:30.640
for us to be the scapegoats.

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:32.840
It won't be the first time...

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:34.760
an old-timer like dad
does these things.

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:44.960
I'm not going back for now.

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:47.520
Since Jin Da Xi is
part of the Tong family,

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.120
and he worked hard outside
for so many years,

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:53.440
let him experience
the rich life too.

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:57.120
I still have amnesia now.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.200
I can't help much
if I go back either.

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.160
Let me regain my memories
and find out the truth first.

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:04.600
Good thinking, Tong Sheng.

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:07.680
Do you have Ms. Yan's number?

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:17.400
Hello, Yan Yan? I'm Tong Sheng.

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:19.720
I need your help with something.

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:31.800
Don't be mad anymore.

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:33.320
Even if he's your brother,

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:34.320
he has the right to love freely.

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:37.440
Or just go home and scold him.

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:40.040
How can a little brother date
without telling his sister, right?

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:45.080
You're leaving, Da Huan?

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:48.640
Get some rest. See you tomorrow.

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:55.440
Are you crazy?

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:02.080
Da Huan, you're back.

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:03.160
Come here.

00:04:03.161 --> 00:04:04.640
Da Xi and I have finished cooking.

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:07.080
What are you doing?

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:10.240
Yan Yan wants to apologize to you.

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:11.560
She hasn't met you before.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.040
She didn't know you're my sister,

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:14.400
so she spoke rudely to you.

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:16.560
She insists on cooking dinner
for you today...

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:17.720
to apologize.

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:20.720
There's no need.

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:25.040
Don't act this way. Have some.

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:26.320
Here.

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:28.720
That's right, my sister.
She's doing this for you.

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:31.080
Why are you calling me
your sister today?

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:33.240
You are my sister.

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:35.160
Come on.

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:36.200
Let's eat together.

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:42.520
This chicken wing is delicious.

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:44.080
Is that so?

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:47.240
That's not right.

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:48.240
We forgot Da Huan...

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:51.080
Da Huan, try this spicy chicken.
It's really good.

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:54.080
You're so thoughtful.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.000
I'm full.

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:06.880
Da Huan, you didn't eat anything.

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:16.520
Thank you for today.

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:18.880
I've helped you as much as I can.

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:20.320
You promised me this.

00:05:20.321 --> 00:05:21.920
Tell me about your twin brother.

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:25.040
The Tong Sheng you met...

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:26.520
is indeed fake.

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:29.320
He's Jin Da Huan's brother,
Jin Da Xi.

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:31.240
I think he doesn't dare
to see you...

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:32.360
because he's afraid of facing you.

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:34.800
We all have vanity.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.800
But there could be other reasons.

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:41.000
However, you still have
to consider...

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:42.800
whether you can accept
that Da Xi lied to you...

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:44.560
and his real family situation.

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:47.080
Of course I'm angry
that he lied to me.

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:49.480
But I don't care
what his identity is.

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:50.839
Think about it carefully.

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:51.840
Don't play tough too much.

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:54.760
I can only think of a way to help
after you've thought things through.

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:04.240
Does your sister dislike me?

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:06.760
Don't be silly. Why would she?

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:19.520
Why exactly am I so mad?

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:31.160
Come in, it's not locked.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:40.720
What's wrong? Are you mad?

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:43.320
Tell me.

00:06:43.321 --> 00:06:44.600
Why did you hide
your relationship...

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:45.840
with Ms. Yan from me?

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:48.040
We're just friends.

00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:49.760
Friends?

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:52.200
What kind of friends
treat each other like this?

00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:55.240
I think you are just a ladies man.

00:06:57.360 --> 00:06:58.480
Are you jealous?

00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:02.880
Jealous? Why would I be jealous?

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:04.720
How could I be jealous?

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:07.480
You're so angry.

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:09.600
I don't believe you don't like me.

00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:13.200
Da Huan.

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:15.160
I want to explain things to you.

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:21.400
Hello, Yu Chen.

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:23.640
Why are you calling me
all of a sudden?

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:24.800
I'm downstairs.

00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:25.920
Come down.

00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:28.720
Okay, I'll be right down.

00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:46.200
Long time no see.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:51.920
Yu Chen, you rarely come back
to the country.

00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:54.760
What big case are you
working on this time?

00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:56.320
It's not a big case.

00:07:56.920 --> 00:07:58.080
From now on,

00:07:58.320 --> 00:07:59.840
it won't be so hard for us
to see each other anymore.

00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:02.200
Why?

00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:05.560
Mr. Chang of Xuebao Group hired me.

00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:08.440
I'm mainly responsible for Wanqi's
investment in Xuebao.

00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:11.040
- What a coincidence.
- Yes.

00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:14.240
So it won't be so hard for us
to meet in the future.

00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:16.720
And logically speaking,

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:18.200
you're even my client.

00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:21.440
Here.

00:08:21.441 --> 00:08:22.880
Let's toast
to our beautiful Da Huan...

00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:24.800
taking good care of me
in the future.

00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:26.600
No, Yu Chen.

00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:28.559
I just joined the company.

00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:29.840
In our company's Legal Department,

00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:32.800
I still have a long way to go
before dealing with the core issues.

00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:34.920
Based on my recent research,

00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:37.719
your company's Legal Department
staff is no good.

00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:38.720
You're different.

00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:40.560
And you have to believe in yourself.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.279
I'll make it clear
to them this time.

00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:44.440
You'll be my counterpart.

00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:47.000
No, Yu Chen.

00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:48.280
That's not appropriate.

00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:50.760
Are you still our school's
Pretty Little Dragon?

00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:54.160
I believe in you.

00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:55.760
You should believe in yourself too.

00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:02.120
Here.

00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:04.880
Let's drink
to our upcoming collaboration.

00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:08.320
Okay, bottoms up for me.

00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:10.880
This is more like you.

00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:19.800
Yes, I've been craving
this place's food for a long time.

00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:21.960
Try this.
