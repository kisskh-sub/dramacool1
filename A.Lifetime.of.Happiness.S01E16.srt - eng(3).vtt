(Episode 16)

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:15.360
(A Hundred Little Things About Love)

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:16.400
Here you go.

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:17.679
What's this?

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:18.720
You're so slow.

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:20.120
It's my sister's dating list.

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:21.840
Dating list?

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:23.680
(Walked a long distance
with me on his back)

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.479
Everything my sister
wants to do is written here.

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:27.240
Think of it as a cheat sheet
to win her over, got it?

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.280
(Cook together...)

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:45.920
Ten things I absolutely have to do
with my boyfriend...

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:48.400
when I'm in a relationship.

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.240
Number one.

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:52.800
Go grocery shopping together
and cook at home.

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:58.599
Come home early tonight.

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.960
I bought ingredients.
Let's cook at home together.

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:07.720
I'm home.

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:11.680
What are you doing?

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.080
I'm cooking.

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:16.840
That's not how you cut vegetables.

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:06.920
Cooking?

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:08.920
I didn't know you could do that.

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:13.240
Number two.

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.280
Watch a horror movie together.

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:51.120
(Horror movie)

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:52.360
A horror movie?

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:54.520
Didn't my sister scare you enough?

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:58.120
Also, bake a cake together.

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:12.240
(Go watch the sea together)

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:20.600
Walk through the park hand in hand.

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:31.000
Wear matching couple outfits.

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:44.560
(Wear matching couple outfits)

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:55.480
(Build a snowman together)

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:58.000
(Go swimming together)

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:12.240
Today is the last day.

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:13.520
Are you confident?

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:15.279
My sister has been
in a good mood lately.

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:16.840
Don't worry.
He has me as his strategist.

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:18.560
I hope everything goes well tonight.

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:21.680
All right.
I've done everything I can.

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:23.160
The rest is up to you.

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:24.560
I believe you can do it.

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:26.600
Okay, enough talking.

00:04:26.601 --> 00:04:28.240
Today is my last day
working at the fish market.

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:29.439
I have to go back
and wrap things up.

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:30.440
I'll go with you.

00:04:30.441 --> 00:04:31.480
What for?

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:32.920
I promised I'd help you out.

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:35.279
Even on the last day,
I've got to be on duty.

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:36.280
Let's go.

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:57.960
I'll pick you up after work.

00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:59.120
See you tonight.

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:09.760
What's the date today?

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:12.760
A month has passed.

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:18.880
The thought that I won't be
your boyfriend after tomorrow...

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:20.600
kind of makes me sad.

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:24.640
How do you know you won't be?

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:27.640
I've thought about it.

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:31.440
I guess you really don't like me,

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:33.640
but I still kept pushing.

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:38.720
Thank you for putting up
with me all this time,

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:41.000
for taking care of my moods,

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:43.440
and for pretending to be happy.

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:47.440
I wasn't pretending.
I really was happy.

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:52.640
I realized that...

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:56.840
I actually love being around you.

00:05:58.640 --> 00:05:59.960
I've decided not to return you.

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:09.360
I was lying.

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:11.040
That's what I thought too.

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:13.440
I never intended to stop here.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:23.600
There's still
one more thing on the list.

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:26.200
What is it?

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:30.040
Don't think I don't know
you stole my notebook.

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:34.240
How did you know
I didn't finish the list?

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:37.360
Close your eyes.

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:40.720
Come on.

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:46.120
Three.

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:48.200
Two.

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:50.040
One.

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:07.840
The last item on the dating list.

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:11.200
Watch a romantic fireworks show,

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:13.240
confess our feelings,

00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:16.040
and kiss beneath the sparks.

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:22.560
Can you give me back
my notebook now?

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:25.240
We've already done everything.
What do you still need it for?

00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:30.200
I might have more things
I want to add to it later.

00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:32.080
There's no need.

00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:34.320
From now on,

00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:36.240
we'll complete it one by one.

00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:38.680
- You said it.
- I said it.

00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:44.640
Hello, Yan Yan.

00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:47.439
Da Huan,
something has happened to Da Xi!

00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:48.880
Turn on the news now.

00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:50.360
What?

00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:53.840
What's going on?

00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:55.400
It's Chang Ming's men.

00:07:55.640 --> 00:07:56.640
What?

00:07:56.641 --> 00:07:57.960
They mistook Da Xi for you...

00:07:58.000 --> 00:07:59.280
and lured him out.

00:08:08.760 --> 00:08:10.200
This is the last time.

00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:11.760
Don't come here with me again.

00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:13.120
What do you mean?

00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:14.400
What if I just insist on
coming with you?

00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:18.000
I mean, don't come here again.

00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:19.800
Where should we go then?

00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:24.560
Maybe a park,

00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:26.240
a street food stall,

00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:28.760
an internet cafÃ©,
or even an amusement park.

00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:34.040
But you still have
to pay me 10,000 yuan a day.

00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:35.239
You're unbelievable.

00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:36.280
I was just kidding.

00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:44.960
Hello, Mr. Tong?

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.080
I have an important document
that needs to be handed over to you.

00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:48.600
Can you pick it up tonight?

00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:53.120
Sure. Where?

00:08:57.800 --> 00:08:58.919
I think I took the wrong phone.

00:08:58.920 --> 00:08:59.920
Who is it?

00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:01.880
I don't know.

00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:04.200
But it seems like he has
something urgent for my brother.

00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:06.560
Tonight is really important
for your brother.

00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:07.840
He definitely won't be free.

00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:09.880
Why don't we go get it for him?

00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:11.720
Okay.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:15.320
When we got there,

00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:17.320
we were surrounded
by a group of people.

00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:21.040
To protect me,
Da Xi told me to run...

00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:23.920
and they went after him by car.

00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:26.960
Da Xi drove
all the way to the bridge,

00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:30.840
but then a truck came out of nowhere
and rammed his car into the water.

00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:33.559
Where is he now?

00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:34.640
They're still searching,

00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:37.720
but the current in that stretch
of the river is really strong.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:39.000
It's hard to say...

00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:41.000
if he'll be found.

00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:43.920
Da Huan.

00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:45.320
Da Huan.

00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:49.760
Da Xi.

00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:54.560
Da Xi.

00:09:54.920 --> 00:09:56.000
Da Xi!

00:09:56.120 --> 00:09:57.120
Da Huan.

00:09:57.360 --> 00:09:58.400
Are you all right?

00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:11.320
Where's Da Xi? Did they find him?

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:18.040
No.

00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:19.480
No way.

00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:22.680
Da Xi might have...

00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:25.440
gone home.

00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:27.160
That's right.

00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:29.600
He didn't bring his phone with him,
so he couldn't contact us.

00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:32.160
That must be it.

00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:34.480
Da Xi.

00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:35.600
I'll go with you.

00:10:35.601 --> 00:10:37.440
No, don't follow me.
