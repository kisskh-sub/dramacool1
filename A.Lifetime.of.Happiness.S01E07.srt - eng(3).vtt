00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.920
(Episode 7)

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:22.800
(How to earn money quickly
High-paying reward)

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:56.400
I'm going to cram school.

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:58.040
What time is it already?

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:31.360
Hello, I'm Jack.

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.400
I used to work at a private bank
in Singapore.

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:35.520
Welcome to my class today.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.640
For what we're going
to talk about today,

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:39.200
please turn to page 10.

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:40.400
Please pay attention.

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:44.199
To capture trends,
you have to capture momentum.

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.720
The king of momentum
is the transport route.

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:47.880
This is very important.

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:48.880
Please take note of this.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.240
Who let you secretly listen here?

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:09.240
You're even taking notes?
Can you understand it?

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:12.559
As a cleaner,
can't you act like one?

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:13.560
How many times has it already been?

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:15.720
Get back to work.

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:20.479
Instead of working hard,

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:21.720
you're listening in
to class for free.

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:34.480
Why are you making yourself
so pitiful?

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:53.520
Why are you here?

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:57.240
I passed by...

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:58.520
so I came to pick you up from work.

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:00.360
How coincidental.

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:02.240
Let's go.

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:10.520
Is the tuition expensive?

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:12.360
Why do you ask?

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:13.960
I'm just asking.

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:18.280
It's 10,000 yuan for 8 classes.

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:24.880
Hello.

00:03:24.881 --> 00:03:26.080
This is Xuebao Group.

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:27.360
Your design proposal...

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:28.560
won the competition this time.

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:30.920
Please come to the company tomorrow
to collect your prize money.

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:32.200
Okay, I got it.

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:34.520
Who was that?

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:36.880
The Xuebao Group.

00:03:36.881 --> 00:03:38.120
The Xuebao Group?

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:40.080
Why are they calling you
at this hour?

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:41.320
They said I won a prize.

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:42.320
They want me to collect it.

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:44.599
You won a prize? How much is it?

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:45.600
It's 100,000 yuan.

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:47.120
It's 100,000 yuan?

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:52.320
It was what you were working on
in the middle of the night?

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:54.960
Anyway, don't worry about it.

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:57.840
I told you, I'll take care of you.

00:03:58.440 --> 00:03:59.440
Wait.

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:01.600
It's 100,000 yuan.

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:03.640
You're not happy at all?

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:05.080
Is 100,000 yuan a lot?

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:06.880
Isn't 100,000 yuan a lot?

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:08.800
The Da Xi in the past...

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:10.480
would be elated.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.480
I don't think 100,000 yuan is a lot.

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:17.120
When will you get
your memories back?

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:21.360
Your sour face
is really annoying right now.

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:25.040
I want...

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:27.440
to trample you to death now.

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:30.039
I'll step on you!

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:31.040
How childish.

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:34.960
I'll step on you!

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:45.800
You didn't want to do it, right?

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:20.680
Tong Sheng, this is our company.

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:22.320
Do you remember it?

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:23.920
Let's go. I'll show you around more.

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:30.400
I'll show Tong Sheng around.

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:52.120
Hello, I'm here to accept the prize.

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:54.280
May I ask where I should go?

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:04.040
Any news from the person
I asked you to find?

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:07.200
I've already asked people
to look for him.

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:09.120
But please also understand.

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:10.960
The scope of the search
is quite broad.

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:15.080
Thank you for your hard work.

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:18.240
This is actually my fault.

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:20.560
I was too busy with work back then.

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:23.720
That's why I lost...

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:25.640
Tong Sheng's twin brother.

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:29.400
Dad, it's not your fault.

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:31.920
The situation was complicated.

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:34.840
Moreover, Madam was careless, so...

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.000
Chang Ming.

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:41.720
I've always thought
you know your place.

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:44.640
That's why I entrusted you
with this task.

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:46.520
I... I'm sorry.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:48.040
I shouldn't have said that.

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:54.240
Keep searching.

00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:58.040
Remember, don't let Tong An
and Tong Sheng know.

00:06:58.720 --> 00:06:59.720
Okay.

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:15.120
What did you say your name is?

00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:16.480
Jin Da Xi.

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:18.360
Da Xi.

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:19.600
Da Xi.

00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:21.920
That's a good name.

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:23.400
What's the matter?

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:24.600
Nothing.

00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:27.239
When you were downstairs,

00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:28.640
did anyone recognize you?

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:34.160
What do you mean?

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:36.000
I mean,

00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:38.440
we have some employees...

00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:40.200
who aren't that bright.

00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:42.080
As you know,

00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:44.000
our company is most famous...

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:46.000
for doing charity work all the time.

00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:48.719
I'd let them do simple jobs.

00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:50.279
But there are always some people...

00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:51.960
who call everyone Mr. Tong.

00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:53.160
They can't be stopped.

00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:54.560
They always go crazy.

00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:58.480
Please understand if you meet them.

00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:00.640
That didn't happen.

00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:03.160
But a few people
suddenly bowed to me.

00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:05.880
That's normal too.

00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:07.520
As you know,

00:08:07.521 --> 00:08:10.280
our company is most famous
for being polite to people,

00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:12.320
especially to talented people
like you.

00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:14.160
Please don't find it strange.

00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:16.040
What exactly is the company
most famous for?

00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:18.720
We're famous for all of that.

00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:21.200
Anyway,

00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:23.400
thank you for your contribution
to our company.

00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:25.040
If we need anything in the future,

00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:26.400
we'll contact you again.

00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:28.800
You should go now.

00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:39.800
Wait.

00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:41.920
I'll see you out.

00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:44.680
Our company is quite strict
with our employees.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.480
Look, that's
our newly-built factory.

00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:51.800
What are you doing?

00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:54.240
I'm just showing you around.

00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:00.000
By the way, you can go now.

00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:03.880
How ridiculous.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:22.000
It's you.

00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:23.920
Our company is very satisfied...

00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:25.320
with the proposal
you made last time.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.000
I have a better job for you now.

00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:31.200
I wonder if you want to consider it.

00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:33.560
What is it?

00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:34.880
Our company...

00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:36.520
has a branch in Shanghai...

00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:38.480
that especially needs
a talent like you.

00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:40.560
In terms of salary,

00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:42.080
it's very good.

00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:43.840
And food and lodging are included.

00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:45.640
After working there for a year,

00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:47.160
we'll give you a property
in the city.

00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:50.680
What do you think?
Do you want to consider it?

00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:56.280
(Xuebao Biotech Industrial Park)

00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:05.480
Mr. Chang, I've investigated.

00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:07.560
Someone named Jin Da Xi
was hospitalized that day.

00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:09.640
He had a concussion
and lost his memories.
