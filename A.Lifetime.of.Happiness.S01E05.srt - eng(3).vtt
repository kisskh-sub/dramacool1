(Episode 5)

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.920
I didn't think
you'd still come to me.

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:20.920
All right, stop pretending.

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:22.480
I already know who you are.

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:25.440
No way.
I got found out this quickly.

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:26.720
How did she find out?

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.320
Every day you pretend
to be some proper young master.

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:31.680
Aren't you tired?

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:32.920
I... I...

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:34.560
Aha! I caught you, didn't I?

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:36.200
All right.

00:00:36.201 --> 00:00:37.640
Introduce yourself properly again.

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:40.880
I didn't expect you to find out.

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:42.520
Actually, I didn't want to.

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:45.040
When I woke up,
I found myself in this mansion...

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:46.280
with so many luxury cars.

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:48.040
So you've lost yourself?

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:50.960
Yes, who wouldn't?

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:55.200
All right.

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:56.999
Actually, I'm...

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.280
You're a playboy.

00:00:58.600 --> 00:00:59.600
Right?

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:02.160
You're just pretending...

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:03.880
because of your identity.

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:07.560
So that's what this is about.

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.880
Darn, I almost let it slip.

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:14.480
That's right.

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.320
Seriously, you got me.

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:19.120
All right, I get it.

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:21.680
Today, let's stop pretending.

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.080
Let's go out and have fun.

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:24.440
Where do you usually go?

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:25.760
Take me with you.

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:28.560
Sure.

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:30.280
I'll take you out
for some fun today.

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:31.800
Let's go.

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:38.600
The balance is running low.
Please remind him to top up.

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:41.040
After all that,

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:42.240
you brought me to a place like this?

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:43.400
Aren't you childish?

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:44.800
I knew you wouldn't like it.

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:46.760
Where did you think I'd take you?

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:49.279
I thought it would be
something like motorcycles,

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:51.120
rock climbing, or bungee jumping.

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:52.280
Then you've come
to the wrong person.

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:54.600
It's not too late
to change your mind.

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:04.640
Why don't guys...

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.440
just play video games at home?

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:08.240
You don't get it, do you?

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:10.280
This is the atmosphere we want.

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.040
What do you say?
Let's play one round.

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:17.240
Let's do it. I'm not afraid.

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:22.200
I'll show you what I'm capable of.

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:23.840
Check A and call out.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.000
You go A, I'll go B.

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:26.040
Got it.

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:27.800
Darn it!

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:30.840
Check B and call out now.

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.200
Don't worry. Leave it to me.

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:34.959
- B site!
- I didn't know...

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:35.960
- Guys, come to B!
- you were such a good shot.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.360
- Losing B!
- You're just too noob.

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:38.440
I need backup! Quick!

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:42.280
Boss!

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:43.280
- Not bad.
- Come quickly!

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:46.320
What kind of aim and rhythm is that?

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:50.039
Guys, go! Enemies at B!

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:51.080
Hurry up!

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:53.600
Why are you so good?

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:56.400
You're just too noob.

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:58.520
How about another round?

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.759
So it was you two
chasing us around...

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:06.800
and attacking in-game earlier?

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:09.919
Sir, it's just a game.

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:11.080
It's normal to get emotional.

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:13.480
What's wrong? Are you a sore loser?

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.560
This girl's pretty good.

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:19.840
You play games every day.

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.680
Why not play
something different with us?

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:23.960
Let's...

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:25.160
Sir.

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:27.640
I hope you...

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:29.200
can be the bigger person
and let this go.

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:31.080
Don't hold it against us.

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:34.960
Get lost!

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:36.480
Go! Hurry!

00:03:36.481 --> 00:03:37.760
- Go after them!
- Move!

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:39.560
Quick!

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:41.440
Where are they?

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:42.920
Where are they?

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:44.160
Split up and find them!

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:45.200
Okay.

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:51.320
Do you think they're gone?

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:53.120
I think so.

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:55.720
What a bunch of losers.

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:03.520
Let's go.

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:04.600
Okay.

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:15.760
Let's go.

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:18.760
- You...
- You first.

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:20.040
You go first.

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:23.640
- Then I'll go first.
- Okay.

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:31.160
Let's go.

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:04.800
Da Huan, let's go home.

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:12.160
Da Huan.

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:13.480
Even if I'm totally broke,

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:15.280
will you still love me?

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:18.280
Once I get on your tricycle,

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:19.960
I'm yours.

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:22.200
Actually,

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:23.519
my real identity is...

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:24.920
the heir of Xuebao Group.

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:27.600
Tong Sheng.

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:29.520
Da Huan.

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:40.360
Mr. Qi.

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:41.680
Are you all right?

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:49.480
Well...

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:56.480
Get lost.

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:02.359
Mr. Qi. I just want to remind you.

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:04.320
We're meeting
with the French client next month.

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:06.839
Here's some information
on French private tutors...

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:08.440
I picked out for you.

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:10.560
Would you like to take a look?

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:18.960
I'm a genius indeed.

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:24.680
So this is the situation.

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:28.319
See if you're interested...

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:30.000
in being my French tutor.

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:32.640
How do you know I can speak French?

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:35.600
Your sister told me.

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:38.280
But I have one condition.

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:40.240
What is it?

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:42.040
Move into my place.

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:46.680
That's the condition.
Will you do it or not?

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:48.360
I refuse.

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:51.360
No.

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:54.280
I've already talked it over
with your sister.

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:56.840
- She agreed.
- She's her. I'm me.

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:02.200
How about this?

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:04.640
Feel free to fill out
this month's salary...

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:06.320
and any requests.

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:08.680
Are you sure?

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:10.520
Fill it out.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:13.000
I'll do it then.

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:14.600
Hurry up.

00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:26.760
(Employment Contract)

00:07:26.761 --> 00:07:28.360
(Party A: Wanqi Department Store
Party B: Jin Da Xi)

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:31.280
How much? 500,000?

00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:32.760
Forget it if you can't.

00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:36.560
In one month,

00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:38.760
I'll win your sister over.

00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:41.920
Okay, deal.

00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:13.200
Wait, you have so much luggage.

00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:14.839
Are you moving...

00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:16.000
or are you on the run?

00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:19.320
This feels strangely familiar.

00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:22.280
It's like I'm meant
to live in a house like this.

00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:25.440
Are you just going to sit there
and watch?

00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:26.720
Come and give me a hand.

00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:29.560
What kind of person is this?

00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:36.080
Don't touch my stuff.

00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:47.440
Do you usually drink
this kind of wine?

00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:48.680
There's nothing I like.

00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:51.440
What's wrong with this wine?
I'm reluctant to let you drink it.

00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:08.120
What kind of taste is this?

00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:09.560
What a waste of money.

00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:15.040
When are you
going to clean this room?

00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:17.920
I want this big room.

00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:20.640
No. Your room is the guest room,
across the hall.

00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:21.760
This is my room.

00:09:21.761 --> 00:09:22.960
I'm not used to living
in a small room.

00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:24.120
I like living in a big room.

00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:26.360
Don't you think
you're going too far?

00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:27.760
- Can't I?
- You...

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:29.000
Forget it if you can't.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:30.000
No.

00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:33.000
Fine.

00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:34.160
Stay here.

00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:35.160
I'll leave.

00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:37.480
Wait.

00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:40.200
- What now?
- Change the bedsheet.

00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:45.960
Okay, I'll do it.

00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:04.480
Why do I feel
like something's wrong?

00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:07.080
Mr. Qi.

00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:09.280
Mr. Qi.

00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:11.680
What now?

00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:16.920
Mr. Qi.

00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:18.559
I'm coming.

00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:19.640
- Mr. Qi.
- What now?

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:22.320
I'm almost out of wine.

00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:24.560
I'll get it for you.

00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:26.120
The air conditioner is a bit hot.

00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:30.520
It's not hot.

00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:32.480
I'll have another plate
of sweet melon.

00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:33.760
Cut it into smaller pieces.

00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:36.880
Okay.

00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:38.760
By the way,

00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:40.240
I want to take a bath.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:42.000
Get it ready for me.

00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:45.000
The water temperature
should be around 36°C.

00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:46.440
I don't like it too hot.

00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:49.760
Okay.

00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:05.040
Is he messing with me?

00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:07.880
It's ready. You can take a bath now.

00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:12.160
Wait.

00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:17.360
Scrub my back.

00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:21.560
Pick it up.

00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:31.520
Come here. Scrub my back.
