00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:13.920
(Episode 4)

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:29.960
I blush when I see you.

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:32.080
My heart beats faster.

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.000
Then do you want to try?

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.000
Oh my gosh,
what did I even dream about?

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:41.520
It's so scary!

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:51.280
Wait.

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:55.480
This can't be real, can it?

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:12.680
Da Huan,
he'll be your brother from now on.

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:15.680
But he's not my brother.
I don't have a brother.

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.720
Although he wasn't
your brother before,

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:19.120
he will be from now on.

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.080
From now on, we're family.

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:24.200
You have to treat him like family.

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:25.680
Take good care of him.

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:27.320
Okay?

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:42.280
Do you want to have breakfast?

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:44.800
Let's eat together.

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:46.280
Last night,

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:50.160
nothing happened between us, right?

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:58.440
Everything happened.

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:00.840
What?

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:11.920
The things you thought of...

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:13.280
and the ones you didn't,

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.000
all of it happened.

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:18.200
No way.

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:19.560
That's impossible.

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:20.960
It must be my imagination.

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:41.080
What's going on?

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:44.000
Could it be...

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:46.680
that I made the first move?

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:50.600
Do you want to try?

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:56.640
No. I'm your brother.

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:04.440
That's impossible.

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:06.040
I'd never make the first move.

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:07.160
I'd never make the first move.

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:10.360
Could it be...

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:12.440
Do you want to try?

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:14.480
No.

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:16.680
What are you doing?

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:31.720
Mr. Qi, why are you here?

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:33.320
I'm here to pick you up.

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:34.680
Da Huan, this is for you.

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:36.720
Take it.

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:40.680
This is your brother, right?

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:58.400
You forgot your bag.

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:02.880
Thank you.

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:04.840
Mr. Qi, let's go.

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:07.400
Bye-bye, buddy.

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:13.760
Hello.

00:04:13.761 --> 00:04:14.960
Mr. Chang, we have a problem.

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:17.120
I'm not sure why,
but Mr. Qi came to see Tong Sheng.

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:33.640
Qi Wen Han, what are you up to?

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:35.600
You secretly went to see Tong Sheng.

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:37.200
Are you trying to double-cross me?

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:39.840
Seriously, you're so annoying.

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:41.480
Fine.

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:43.520
I'll be straight with you.

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:45.680
I'm done playing.

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:47.680
What do you mean?

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:49.240
What do I mean?

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:50.799
Isn't it just investing?

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:51.960
I don't want in anymore, okay?

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:54.480
I'm not interested
in your family drama at all.

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:55.680
I don't want to get involved either.

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:56.840
Don't forget.

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:59.120
You were involved
in the car accident too.

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:00.880
You can't back out
just because you want to.

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:02.840
You're the one
who caused the car accident.

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:04.680
I'm just someone who knows about it.

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:06.000
And what is this?

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:07.760
Are you threatening me?

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:09.320
Who do you think you are?

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:11.640
And you say I'm involved?

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:13.720
Do you have proof?

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:15.800
You're funny.

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:24.400
Darn it!

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:32.200
What's wrong with you, newcomer?

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:34.400
How could you even get
the printed version wrong?

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:39.080
(Bid Proposal)

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:41.359
It's correct.

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:42.800
This is the copy
you gave me yesterday.

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:43.920
What do you mean?

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:46.160
Are you saying I sent the wrong one?

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:48.240
Let me check again.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:51.000
Come here.

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:53.520
What are you doing?
Don't you know who she is?

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:54.640
Who?

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
Mr. Qi was the one
who drove her here this morning.

00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:58.280
Who do you think she is?

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:04.520
I'm sorry.

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:06.320
I'll just print a new copy myself.

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:08.160
- I won't trouble you.
- I...

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:20.440
Da Huan, this is for you.

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:22.640
Take it.

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:32.039
Dude.

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:33.200
Come on, dude.

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:35.800
What are you doing?
Go make fishcakes.

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:37.440
I don't know how.

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:39.040
Looks like the crash
really knocked him silly.

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:41.240
It's okay. I'll do it later.

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:44.440
But you have
to promise me one thing.

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:45.960
What is it?

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:49.280
Do you still remember
my silly eldest son?

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:51.760
The one who's about
the same age as your sister.

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:54.680
My wife and I have been
thinking about it lately.

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:57.640
Do you want to consider
setting your sister up with...

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:01.840
Think about it.

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:04.600
My son may look like a fool,

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:06.640
but he's the ultimate good guy.

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:09.680
Your sister won't lose out
if she's with him.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:11.040
I've already said so much.

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:12.240
See if you're...

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:14.879
Da Xi, what are you doing?

00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:16.840
The answer's no.
She has a boyfriend.

00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:19.279
No. She doesn't.

00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:20.879
She didn't have one
when I asked her a few days ago.

00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:23.800
She does. From now on, she does.

00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:25.600
Okay. I won't ask anymore.

00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:28.159
I think he didn't just
get knocked silly,

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:29.640
he got knocked crazy too.

00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:44.600
Da Huan, you're off work?

00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:46.200
Get in. I'll take you home.

00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:47.400
Look.

00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:50.199
- This girl is really something.
- Yes.

00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:51.560
She's latched onto Mr. Qi.

00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:56.120
Da Huan, let's go home.

00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:03.080
Can't believe you made it here
in that beat-up car.

00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:05.080
Da Huan, get in my car.
I'll take you home.

00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:07.080
Look.

00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:21.079
She's really something.

00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:22.080
Yes.

00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:26.800
Come on, let's go home.

00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:31.360
What... What's going on?

00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:44.040
Try it.

00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:45.760
What is this?

00:08:45.761 --> 00:08:47.400
Everyone at the headquarters
is dressed nicely.

00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:49.440
You're in the Legal Department now,

00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:51.680
so you can't keep dressing
like a receptionist.

00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:03.600
It feels like something is missing.

00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:17.280
What do you think? Is it nice?

00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:34.640
How much is it?

00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:37.320
It's over 30,000.
It really suits you.

00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:39.080
It's over 30,000?

00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:41.080
Jin Da Xi, are you crazy?

00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:42.360
Go and return it.

00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:55.240
It's just money.

00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:57.160
I can make it back.

00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:01.200
I have a way.

00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:04.040
What could you possibly do?

00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:06.520
If I say I have a way, then I do.

00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:09.760
I'm looking for Tong Sheng.

00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:11.920
This way, please.

00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:18.880
I didn't think
you'd still come to see me.

00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:21.920
All right, stop pretending.

00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:23.400
I already know who you are.
