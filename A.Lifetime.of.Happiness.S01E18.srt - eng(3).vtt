(Episode 18)

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:22.080
Young Master,
I've packed your luggage.

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:25.879
Tong Sheng, you're leaving so early?

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:27.000
Isn't your flight in the afternoon?

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:28.960
I want to go out for a walk.

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:30.720
There are places I want to visit.

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:32.360
Don't tell me you know
about postpartum care too.

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.960
How does it feel
to lose your memory?

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:00.119
(We are recognized
as a baby-friendly hospital)

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:01.680
Mr. Tong, it's almost time.

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:02.920
We should go.

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:11.600
Da Huan,

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:13.840
goodbye.

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:22.080
Da Xi?

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:27.880
Da Xi!

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:31.760
Da Xi, stop!

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:33.200
Da Xi!

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:40.440
Da Xi!

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.680
This is the sales report
for this quarter.

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:54.840
Take a careful look.

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:56.640
And this.

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:58.640
I need to take this call.

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:04.080
Hello?

00:03:04.081 --> 00:03:07.120
Hello, are you Tong Sheng's family?

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:10.280
- Who?
- Do you know Tong Sheng?

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:12.519
Who are you?

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:13.759
I'm calling from the city hospital.

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:15.879
A man had an accident.

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:17.120
He was brought
to the emergency room.

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:18.759
But he doesn't remember anything.

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:20.119
He only remembers your number.

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:21.600
Can you come over?

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:44.400
Who are you?

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:46.160
You remember my number,

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.000
but you don't know
who I am, Tong Sheng?

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:50.440
Tong Sheng?

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.200
You mean...

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:55.440
my name is Tong Sheng?

00:03:58.320 --> 00:03:59.560
You don't remember me?

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:01.360
I'm Da Huan.

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:03.240
Da Huan?

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:09.760
You really don't remember me?

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:13.440
I don't.

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:17.080
But for some reason,

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:19.280
when I hear that name,

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:22.360
I feel so sad.

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:27.480
Did anything bad happen
between us?

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:37.640
No.

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:41.000
Everything that happened
between us was beautiful.

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:44.320
It's something I'll never forget.

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:53.720
Hello, Tong An.

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:55.280
Tong Sheng had an accident.

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:56.720
He's at the city hospital.

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:59.120
What? We've been looking
for him everywhere.

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:02.520
I think he lost his memory again.

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:03.840
Again?

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:05.920
Take him to a safe place first.

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:08.720
Why don't you take him home first?

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:10.000
I'll pick him up right away.

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:11.360
Don't let news of this leak.

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:14.600
Okay.

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:25.279
You really don't remember anything?

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:26.360
Nothing at all?

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:30.480
I only remember that someone
called Jin Da Huan lives here.

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:34.440
Why do you only remember her?

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:38.440
She might be
someone very important to me.

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:44.960
Tong Sheng!

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:46.080
Tong Sheng!

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:49.920
Your family is here to pick you up.

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:51.280
Go home with them.

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:52.640
I...

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:53.880
No.

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:55.040
They are bad people!

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:56.040
I don't want to go with them!

00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:58.560
Tong Sheng!

00:05:58.561 --> 00:06:00.200
Don't worry. I'll find him.

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:13.720
Hello?

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:15.359
Da Huan, good news!

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:17.360
They found Da Xi!

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:20.240
What?

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:21.960
Who?

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:23.920
Da Xi?

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:25.960
Where is he?

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:27.240
He has gone home.

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:36.560
Da Xi.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:40.360
You're still alive.

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:44.240
It's good that you're back.

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:47.720
May I know who you are?

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:51.720
Have you lost your memory?

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:54.920
I'm your sister. Have you forgotten?

00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:57.080
I don't know who I am either.

00:06:57.400 --> 00:06:59.800
But someone asked me
to bring you something.

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:10.560
Da Huan, I hope I didn't scare you.

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:13.759
I didn't know how to tell you this,

00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:15.840
but everyone said
to give you a surprise.

00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:20.559
Why are you hesitating?
Get to the point.

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:22.239
Be quiet. He's the main character.

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:23.240
Let him speak.

00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:27.359
Yes, that's right.

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:29.600
The person in front of you
is Jin Da Xi.

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:32.400
But he seems
to have lost his memory.

00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:33.759
But it's okay.

00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:35.039
I'm sure he'll remember.

00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:37.320
After all, you could say
we're experienced in this matter.

00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:42.320
What exactly is going on?

00:07:57.360 --> 00:07:58.360
Da Xi!

00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:04.200
Stop running.
Don't you recognize me?

00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:09.080
We've been trying
to contact his family.

00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:11.360
But he was found on the shore.

00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:13.440
He didn't have
any identification on him.

00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:16.800
And he suffered from memory loss
after he drowned.

00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:19.520
But fortunately,
the brain damage isn't too serious.

00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:22.680
If he rests for a while,
he'll gradually recover.

00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:25.080
That's what happened.

00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:28.560
But why are you here?

00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:31.360
Of course I have to be here.

00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:32.480
And I want to know...

00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:35.360
how you are going to tell Da Huan...

00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:36.920
all the things that should
and shouldn't be said.

00:08:41.040 --> 00:08:43.080
I have a great idea.
Do you want to hear it?

00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:45.120
I think we should...

00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:46.880
give Da Huan a surprise.

00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:50.039
Surprise? What surprise?

00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:52.200
Let's put on a play together.

00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:53.400
I'm the director.

00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:54.879
Not only am I going to direct,

00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:55.880
I'm going to act too.

00:08:56.080 --> 00:08:57.120
Me too.

00:08:58.040 --> 00:08:59.720
Director, give me a role.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:01.520
What does this have to do with you?

00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:03.880
It's none of your business.
You do your part. I'll do mine.

00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:05.520
Come on.

00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:08.720
Please.

00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:10.040
Is this it?

00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:12.479
All right, fine.

00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:13.480
I'll take it.

00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:16.079
You cheated!

00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:17.440
How have I cheated?

00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:19.200
I have one too.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:21.000
Although it's hard to say...

00:09:21.001 --> 00:09:23.160
whether this will end up
as a surprise or a shock,

00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:24.840
everyone can't wait...

00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:26.280
for you to get this news,

00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:27.439
especially...

00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:28.440
Da Huan.

00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:35.320
I used to think...

00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:37.520
we wouldn't have the chance
to be together anymore.

00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:43.640
But I didn't expect...

00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:45.960
God to give me another chance.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.960
So will you start over with me?
