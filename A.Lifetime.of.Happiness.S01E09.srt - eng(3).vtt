(Episode 9)

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.080
Tong Sheng, what exactly
have you been doing lately?

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:19.040
It's such an important contract.

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:22.000
How could you leave such a big
loophole for people to exploit?

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:23.640
Are you stupid?

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.360
Dad, don't be angry.

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:29.080
Tong Sheng is still recovering.

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:30.520
Don't blame him.

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:33.280
If you haven't recovered,
don't go anywhere.

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:34.640
Rest at home.

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.920
Leave the company
to Chang Ming for now.

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:40.040
All right. That's all.

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:52.360
So this is what you want to do.

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:57.560
How is my family matter
any of your business?

00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:59.200
You've gone too far.

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:00.440
You're taking advantage.

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:10.480
Good morning, Da Huan.

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.200
Have you had breakfast?

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:15.680
Mr. Qi.

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:17.240
The company is so busy lately.

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:18.840
You didn't have to come.

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.200
It's on the way.

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:21.200
Let's go. I'll take you to eat.

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.080
Mr. Qi, I don't think
it's appropriate.

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.720
There's a rumor going around
in the company lately...

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.480
- that you and I...
- What's inappropriate with this?

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:29.840
Get in the car. Let's go.

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:31.120
There's no need.

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:33.720
I'll give you a ride.

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.080
Wait, how are you going to do that?

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:37.320
With your crappy tricycle?

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:38.320
It's not like
she hasn't ridden in it.

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:39.720
It's none of your business.

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:42.079
Wait, can that compare
to this car of mine?

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:43.120
Why are you here?

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.480
I'm asking why you're here.

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:53.560
Me?

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:55.080
I know.

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.800
This is the hidden side
of you, right?

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:58.800
Pretending to be poor
and dating an older girl.

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:01.520
Who are you? What do you mean?

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:03.080
You're really heartless.

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:04.680
You said you'd pretend not to know
me, and you're doing that.

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:06.519
Why did you forcefully
break up with me?

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:08.120
You can tell me
if you don't have feelings for me.

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:09.200
I'd back off.

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:10.240
Wait.

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.920
What do you mean by that?

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:14.440
Who exactly are you?

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:16.320
Ma'am, I didn't ask you.

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:18.440
Who are you calling ma'am?

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:20.560
Is there anyone else here?

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:22.160
Who is she?

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:23.160
I don't know her.

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:24.960
Did you hear that?

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:25.960
He doesn't know you.

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.559
Ma'am, I don't care
about your business.

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:30.560
I don't want to know either.

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:32.799
But he has
to make things clear to me today.

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:34.960
Don't keep saying that.

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:36.680
What's your relationship with him?

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:38.360
Who are you to question
my younger brother?

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:40.520
Your younger brother?

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.319
So he likes older women like you?

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:44.520
Watch your mouth.

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:46.880
I want to comment about you.
What can you do about it?

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:48.480
Look at the bags under your eyes.

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:49.600
Isn't it obvious?

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:51.599
Look at you.

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.600
At a young age, you have
deeper laugh lines than I do,

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.000
and you're one to talk.

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:57.840
I really don't know
what he sees in you.

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.000
You're crazy.

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:02.600
Do you know her?

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:03.800
I don't.

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:04.920
Go and stop the fight.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.839
Wait, how can I stop the fight
if you don't even know her?

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:07.840
Go.

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:11.120
That's enough, Da Huan.

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:12.920
It's getting late.
We're going to be late for work.

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:14.200
Let's go.

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:21.520
Well, we'll get going.

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:24.400
But you two have a good talk.

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:27.920
It's better to make things clear.

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:30.160
It's better to be clear.

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:32.480
Stop talking nonsense with them.
Get in the car.

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:34.040
Okay.

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:45.520
Tong Sheng, can we have a good talk?

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:46.920
What did you call me?

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:12.760
Mr. Chang.

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:13.880
Yan Yan met Mr. Tong.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.000
What?

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:21.440
I got it.

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:39.920
You're really heartless.

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:41.560
You said you'd pretend not to know
me, and you're doing that.

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:43.120
Why did you forcefully
break up with me?

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:45.039
You can tell me
if you don't have feelings for me.

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:46.040
I'd back off.

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:47.480
Jin Da Xi...

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:49.120
keeps telling me
he doesn't have a girlfriend.

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:58.520
Who is that girl?

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:06.800
He's secretly dating,
and he dares to keep it from me.

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:23.480
Don't be mad anymore.

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:25.280
Have some good food.

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:27.160
This shop's cake is really tasty.

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:31.559
Actually,

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:33.400
I know who that girl is.

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:35.440
Who is she?

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:39.760
She's the daughter
of the Yan family.

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:43.720
The daughter of a rich family...

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:46.360
actually fell
for an egomaniac like your brother.

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:48.080
She's really blind.

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:50.360
But don't worry.

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:52.280
She's a nice person.

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:54.320
She's kind,

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:55.919
experienced, and knowledgeable.

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:56.920
She's nice?

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:00.080
She's rude
and has no matters at all.

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:09.920
He's all grown up, it's normal
to be unable to control him.

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:12.240
He's secretly dating someone...

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:13.760
and doesn't want to tell you.

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:15.800
Maybe he wants to surprise you.

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:21.960
We just don't know
how long they've been dating.

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:23.880
Maybe...

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:27.560
something already happened
between them.

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:50.559
Tong Sheng, what exactly
is going on?

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:52.120
You have to explain it clearly
to me today.

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:53.519
The person you saw...

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:54.720
is someone named Tong Sheng,

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:56.320
the son of a group's owner.

00:06:57.600 --> 00:06:58.679
What are you talking about?

00:06:58.680 --> 00:06:59.800
That means...

00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:02.680
there's someone who looks exactly
like me in this world.

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:05.240
Maybe we accidentally
switched identities.

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:07.640
And I'm actually the son
of that group's owner,

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:09.640
not Jin Da Huan's brother,
Jin Da Xi.

00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:15.200
No wonder.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:17.000
In that case,

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:18.920
everything makes sense now.

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:27.800
Hello.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:29.200
Do you have time for a chat?

00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:31.640
It's about your true identity.
